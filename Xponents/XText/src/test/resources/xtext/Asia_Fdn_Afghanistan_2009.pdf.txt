Afghanistan in 2009 1
Preface
2009 has been a formative year for the people of  Afghanistan.  In the 12 months since 
The Asia Foundation conducted its last survey of  Afghan public opinion in 2008, the 
domestic and international landscape has shifted considerably, heralding renewed emphasis 
on this nation determined to find its path forward in the post-Taliban era.  Defined by 
presidential and provincial council elections and an uptick in insurgent activity, these 
shifts have delivered both noted accomplishment and tragedy in 2009. Despite modest 
improvements in basic infrastructure, public services, education, and health, civilian 
and military casualties have reached unsettling levels. Add natural disasters, inclement 
weather conditions, and a renewed anti-insurgency campaign in Pakistan to the dynamic 
and conditions are considerably difficult for the average Afghan. These challenging 
surroundings notwithstanding, The Asia Foundation successfully conducted its fifth 
nationwide assessment of  Afghan public opinion. This report, outlining findings and 
methodology, is the material result of  that effort.
Aiming to provide policy makers and influential 
actors in government, civil society, the international 
community, and the broader Afghan citizenry with 
useful, actionable information, the 2009 Survey of  
the Afghan People is a comprehensive assessment 
of  national perception in several key policy areas 
including security, economy, governance, democratic 
values, and women and society.  Expanding from its 
limited scope in 2004 and building upon previous 
surveys conducted in 2006, 2007, and 2008, the 
2009 survey continues to track core appraisal areas 
while revising its nuances and methodology to 
meet contemporary constraints and demands.  The 
survey’s value can be found in its reliable consistency 
to measure public perception systematically in each passing year, making it an important 
public policy tool and “snapshot” barometer of  public opinion in Afghanistan.
The 2009 survey, like previous surveys, employed a standard questionnaire designed to 
solicit actionable responses from typical Afghans which would prove useful to policy 
makers, social researchers, and donor organizations and their interventions. In addition to 
core tracking questions included in the questionnaire since the survey’s initial inception in 
2004, the Foundation consulted with select experts, stakeholders, and donors for review 
and suggestions for new assessment elements in 2009.  This is reflected in the survey by a 
greater emphasis placed in the areas of  sub-national governance, economy and development, 
women and society, and democratic values at the request of  stakeholders.  The conduct of  
presidential elections in 2009 also played a palpable and influential role throughout.

points in the mountains of Badakhshan province.

Operationally, 648 field surveyors throughout all 34 provinces of  Afghanistan interviewed 
6,406 adult Afghans between June 17 and July 6, 2009 to construct the 2009 report data 
sets.   Sample points were randomly distributed proportional to geographical and residential 
characteristics with “Kish” grids to select the individual respondents.  Instability, the presence 
of  active fighting, logistical constraints, and natural impediments such as flooding in some 
provinces caused a number of  sampling points to be tactically adjusted or replaced to keep 
interviewers out of  harms way and able to conduct their collection of  data.  Full details 
on the methodology of  the survey are available in Appendix 2 of  this report.  The survey 
questionnaire, with percentage of  responses by question, can be found in Appendix 3.
Not only providing a peek into Afghan perceptions at a specific point in time or tool 
to measure shifts in public opinion, the survey represents the most visible product of  
a comprehensive approach by The Asia Foundation to build Afghan research capacity. 
Although the survey was commissioned, developed, and managed by The Asia Foundation’s 
Afghanistan Office, several Afghan organizations benefited from the symbiotic partnerships 
forged by the program.  Fieldwork was conducted by the Kabul-based Afghan Center for 
Socio-economic and Opinion Research (ACSOR) which has received support from The 
Asia Foundation since 2006.  An internship program to build capacity for students and 
serve the broader Afghan research community was continued from 2008 in partnership 
with the National Centre for Policy Research (NCPR) at Kabul University.  In addition to 
specialized trainings, selected students completed projects and received practical hands-
on work experience through placements with various research organizations.  The Asia 
Foundation also offered specialized training on statistical tools for personnel from the 
Afghan Government’s Central Statistic Organization (CSO). Further internships and 
trainings are planned for later this year. 
In terms of  program implementation, the initial analysis and write-up of  the 2009 survey 
report was provided by Mr. Sudhindra Sharma and Mr. Pawan Sen from Inter-Disciplinary 
Analysts (IDA), a partner of  The Asia Foundation located in Kathmandu, Nepal.  Ms. 
Ruth Rennie, consultant to the Foundation, completed the analysis and constructed the 
final version of  the survey report.  In Afghanistan, Mr. Sunil Pillai, Mr. Fazel Rabi Wardak, 
and Mr. Michael Haines managed the overall day-to-day activities of  the survey project.  
Finally, the generous support and confidence of  The United States Agency for International 
Development (USAID) and its team of  professionals made this important research and 
capacity building tool possible.

1 Executive Summary
1.1 Key Findings
In 2009, 42 percent of  respondents say that the country is moving in the right di-• 
rection. This figure is higher than in 2008 (38%). Similarly, 29 percent feel that the 
country is moving in the wrong direction compared to 32 percent in 2008, signaling 
a check on the trend of  declining optimism that had been evident since 2006. 
The main reason for optimism continues to be good security which has been men-• 
tioned by an increasing proportion of  respondents each year, from 31 percent in 
2006 to 44 percent in 2009. More respondents in 2009 also mention reconstruction 
and rebuilding (36%) and opening of  schools for girls (21%) as reasons for optimism 
than in previous years.  
Insecurity also remains the most important reason for pessimism, cited by 42 percent • 
of  respondents. However, the proportion of  respondents that highlight insecurity in 
2009 has fallen since 2008 when half  of  respondents (50%) emphasized this factor.
Insecurity (including attacks, violence and terrorism) is identified as the biggest prob-• 
lem in Afghanistan by over a third of  respondents (36%), particularly in the South 
East (48%), West (44%) and South West (41%). However, concern about other is-
sues such as unemployment (35%), poor economy (20%), corruption (17%), poverty 
(11%) and education (11%) has increased in 2009 compared to 2008.
A slightly higher proportion of  respondents give a positive assessment of  the se-• 
curity situation in their local area in 2009 (64%) than in 2008 (62%). Although im-
provements were reported in almost all regions of  the country, it is to be considered 
that there were greater restrictions on the movement of  survey researchers due to 
security concerns and other reasons in 2009 compared to previous years (refer to 
Appendix 2: Methodology for details).
Just over half  of  respondents (51%) say they fear for their personal safety in their • 
local area. However, much higher proportions of  respondents report at least some-
times having fears for their safety in the South East (65%), South West (62%) and 
West (62%), than in other parts of  the country. There has also been a significant rise 
in the incidence of  crime and violence experienced by respondents in these regions 
since 2008.
Afghanistan in 20094
Seventeen percent of  respondents report that they or someone in their family have • 
been victims of  violence or crime in the past year. Nearly one in ten victims of  
violence report that this was due to the actions of  militias and insurgents (9%) or 
foreign forces (9%). The incidence of  victimization from military type actions has 
been rising steadily since 2007. Violence resulting from militant/insurgent actions is 
mentioned most often in the Central/Hazarajat (24%), East (17%), Central/Kabul 
(11%), South East (9%) and South West (8%). Whereas violence due to the actions 
of  foreign forces is most commonly reported in the South West (22%), South East 
(11%) and East (10%).
The proportion of  respondents who express fear to vote in a national election rose • 
significantly between 2008 and 2009 (from 45% to 51%). This is now true for the 
majority of  respondents in the South West (79%), South East (68%), West (61%) 
and East (56%) of  the country.
In 2009, Afghans give a more positive assessment of  their economic situation than • 
in previous years, although this prosperity is not evenly shared. Considerably more 
urban respondents (63%) than rural residents (52%) say they are more prosperous 
today than they were under the Taliban. 
Unemployment continues to feature amongst the most important problems at both • 
national (35%) and local (26%) levels. Other major problems at the local level con-
cern basic infrastructure and services such as electricity (26%), roads (24%), water 
(22%) and lack of  health care/clinics/hospitals (20%), as in previous years. 
In terms of  local amenities and services, respondents continue to report the greatest • 
satisfaction with the availability of  education for children (67%), water for drinking 
(63%) and irrigation (53%) and clinics and hospitals (49%). 
Around two-thirds of  respondents (65%) say that the supply of  electricity in their • 
local areas is bad and a third of  respondents (33%) report having no access to any 
kind of  electricity. This is significantly lower than in previous years. 
Assessments of  the performance of  the national government have risen slightly from • 
67 percent in 2008 to 71 percent in 2009. The most commonly mentioned achieve-
ments of  the current government are reconstruction (32%), establishing peace and 
security (27%) and a better education system (26%). The most commonly mentioned 
government failings are insecurity (31%), administrative corruption (29%), lack of  
job opportunities (20%), weak economy (15%) and weak government (13%).
The majority of  respondents (71%) support the government’s attempts to address • 
the security situation through negotiation and reconciliation with armed anti-gov-
Afghanistan in 2009 5
ernment elements. The high level of  support for this approach is likely to be influ-
enced by the fact that a majority of  respondents (56%) say they have some level of  
sympathy with the motivations of  armed opposition groups. 
Confidence in representative bodies and their responsiveness to addressing issues of  • 
local concern remains relatively high. Sixty-eight percent of  respondents say parlia-
ment is addressing the major problems of  people in Afghanistan and 58 percent 
say that their MP is addressing the major problems of  their constituency in the 
Parliament. Satisfaction with the performance of  MPs in this regards shows a small 
improvement in 2009 compared to 2008.
At the local level respondents give the most positive assessment of  the performance • 
of  Provincial Councils (75%), followed by district authorities (69%) and munici-
palities (58%). However, in 2009 satisfaction with the performance of  municipal 
authorities has increased while satisfaction with Provincial Councils and district au-
thorities has remained stable.
In 2009, a significantly higher proportion of  respondents than in previous years • 
mention freedom (50%) and peace (41%) as the greatest personal benefits they ex-
pect from democracy. This year respondents give greater importance to core demo-
cratic values such as rights and law (24%), women’s right (21%), government of  the 
people (19%) and Islamic democracy (23%). However, they show less confidence in 
the likelihood of  democracy delivering more tangible benefits such as less corrup-
tion (17%) or prosperity (15%).
The proportion of  respondents who say that democracy is the best form of  gov-• 
ernment available continues to fall, from 84 percent in 2006 to 78 percent in 2009. 
However, since 2008 there has been no change in the level of  satisfaction with the 
way democracy is working in Afghanistan (68%).  
Agreement with the principle of  equal rights continues to fall over time, from 90 • 
percent in 2006 and 2007 to 84 percent in 2008 and to 80 percent in 2009. The same 
is true of  support for the principle of  peaceful political opposition which has fallen 
from 84 percent in 2006 to 77 percent in 2009. There is also a decline in the accep-
tance of  differences in political allegiances between individuals, from 54 percent in 
2006 to 40 percent in 2009. However, support for allowing opposition parties to hold 
local meetings rose significantly from 44 percent in 2008 to 54 percent in 2009.
2009 sees a certain renewed confidence in the electoral process. Seventy percent • 
of  respondents say they believe that voting can lead to improvement, reversing the 
trend of  the last two years. This is accompanied by a steady rise in the proportion 
Afghanistan in 20096
of  respondents who say they can have some degree of  influence over government 
decisions from 36 percent in 2006 to 42 percent in 2009. 
2009 also sees a significant rise in public confidence in a number of  election-related in-• 
stitutions including the Independent Election Commission (from 58% in 2008 to 67% 
in 2009) and political parties (47%, which is the highest recorded figure since 2006).
The survey was conducted in June 2009 with the Presidential and Provincial Council elec-• 
tions scheduled for August. Two months before the elections 82 percent of  respondents 
were aware of  the elections and 77 percent had registered to vote. Voter registration 
was significantly higher amongst men (85%) than women (69%). Around three quarters 
(73%) of  those who had not registered said they did not know where to do this.
Seventy-three percent of  registered voters said they were likely to vote including • 
48 percent who said this was very likely. However, significant proportions in the 
South West (35%), South East (29%), Central/Kabul (27%) and West (25%) said 
they were unlikely to vote. The proportion of  respondents who report having no 
interest in participating in the elections rose sharply in 2009, and has more than 
doubled since 2004 (from 12% to 16% in 2005, 18% in 2008 and 26% in 2009). 
Security concerns were also prevalent (18%), particularly in the South East (25%) 
and South West (30%). 
Sixty-four percent of  respondents said that the upcoming elections would be free • 
and fair.  Those who thought otherwise identified a range of  potential problems 
including cheating in the vote count (39%) and buying of  votes (33%). Only a small 
proportion mentioned intimidation against voters or party activists (8%). Doubts 
about the elections being free and fair were highest in the South West (37%), South 
East (29%), Central/Kabul (25%) and West (23%) regions.  
Views on freedom of  expression continue to be divided. Forty percent of  respon-• 
dents say that most people feel free to express their opinions but an almost equal pro-
portion (39%) say they do not. The proportion of  respondents who say it is unaccept-
able to talk negatively about the government continues to fall, from 69% in 2007 to 
61 percent in 2009. The proportion who mention poor local security conditions as a 
barrier to freedom of  expression is also lower in 2009 (29%) than in any previous year 
(40% in 2006, 36% in 2007, 38% in 2008), although there is a small increase in those 
who explicitly mention a threat from the Taliban (21%) compared to 2008 (18%).
Support for consultation with religious leaders in government decision-making and • 
to resolve local problems continues to rise, with the highest levels of  support in the 
East (82%), and South West (72%) of  the country. 
Afghanistan in 2009 7
As in previous years, edu• cation and illiteracy (49%) remain the major problems 
facing women in Afghanistan. However, over the same period there has been a 
consistent rise in the proportion of  respondents who identify the lack of  employ-
ment opportunities for women as a significant issue, from two percent in 2006 to 19 
percent in 2007, 24 percent in 2008 and 28 percent in 2009.
State• d support for gender equality remains high, including equal educational 
opportunities (87%) and women’s right to vote (83%). The proportion who say that 
women should be allowed to work outside the home has decreased marginally each 
year from 71 percent in 2006  to its lowest level in 2009 (67%). 
Results in 2009 also show a significant decline in support for female representation • 
in governance bodies at all levels compared to previous years. 
Radio remains the most accessible media for Afghan household, particularly in rural • 
areas. However there has been a steady decline in radio ownership and radio listen-
ership since 2007. The proportion of  respondents who get their information from 
Television continues to rise but is still largely confined to urban areas.
2009 saw a dramatic rise in mobile telephone ownership compared to previous years. • 
This has meant that for the first time the majority of  respondents (52%) now have 
access to this technology.
1.2 Summary
In 2009, more respondents say that the country is moving in the right direction and 
fewer say it is going in the wrong direction than in 2008, signaling a check on the 
trend of  declining optimism that had been evident since 2006. 
Security continues to remain a key concern for Afghans and a critical factor by 
which they judge the progress and direction of  their country’s development. The 
survey data in 2009 suggests that there have been some improvements in this area 
and that respondents have a more positive view of  the security situation than has 
been the case in the past two years1. Good security is mentioned by an increasing 
proportion of  respondents each year as the main reason for optimism. Insecurity 
remains the most important reason for pessimism; however, fewer respondents 
cited this reason in 2009 than in 2008. A slightly higher proportion of  respondents 
1 It should be considered that in 2009 survey researchers faced much greater restrictions on their move-
ments due to security concerns than in previous years. For the 2009 survey, more than 100 randomly 
selected sampling points across the country were inaccessible due to security reasons (see Appendix 2: 
Methodology). 
Afghanistan in 20098
also give a positive assessment of  the security situation in their local area than in 
2008 in almost all regions. 
Nonetheless, insecurity still emerges as the biggest problem in Afghanistan, with 
particular impact in the South East, South West and West of  the country. Much 
higher proportions of  respondents in these regions report at least sometimes having 
fears for their safety and the proportion of  respondents who say they often fear for 
their safety has been rising steadily over the last four years. There has also been a 
significant rise in the incidence of  crime and violence experienced by respondents in 
these regions since 2008. 
Although experienced by a small minority of  respondents (9%), the incidence of  
victimization from the actions of  militias and insurgents or foreign forces has been 
rising steadily since 2007, indicating that the ongoing hostilities continue to have a 
perceptible impact on the lives of  the Afghan people. This kind of  conflict-related 
violence is a particular concern again in the South West, South East, East and also 
in the Central/Hazarajat and Central/Kabul regions where high levels of  violence 
related to militias and insurgents are reported.
The majority of  respondents support the government’s attempts to address the se-
curity situation through negotiation and reconciliation with armed anti-government 
elements. The high level of  support for this approach is likely to be influenced by 
the fact that a small majority of  respondents say they have some level of  sympathy 
with the motivations of  armed opposition groups. There is little variation between 
ethnic groups, but there are significant regional differences. Around two thirds of  
respondents have some level of  sympathy with such groups in the South East and 
East, but this is true for less than half  of  respondents in the Central/Kabul and 
Central/Hazarajat regions.
Yet a sense of  optimism remains. The majority of  respondents expect the security 
situation in their local area to improve in the next year, although, in regions where 
insecurity is a major problem, respondents are much less optimistic about future 
improvements.  
Levels of  insecurity continue to have an impact on respondent’s willingness to par-
ticipate in a range of  public activities. Between 2008 and 2009 the proportion of  
respondents who say they would be afraid to vote in a national election rose signifi-
cantly. This was the case for the majority of  respondents in the South West, South 
East, East and West of  the country reflecting the significant impact of  insecurity on 
democratic participation in this election year.
Afghanistan in 2009 9
Afghans continue to express high levels of  confidence in state security services. Per-
ceptions of  the operational capacity of  both the Afghan National Police (ANP) and 
the Afghan National Army (ANA) have been improving since 2007. However, this 
does not necessarily translate into greater satisfaction with their performance. Fewer 
respondents in 2009 say the ANP helps to improve security or is honest and fair than 
in previous years, although assessments of  the ANA’s performance remain stable.
In 2009, Afghans also give a more positive assessment of  their economic situation 
than in previous years, although this prosperity is not evenly shared. Considerably 
more urban than rural residents report that they are more prosperous now than 
under the Taliban regime. Only a minority of  respondents say this is the case in the 
South East and South West. 
Again in 2009, in terms of  local services and amenities, respondents report the high-
est levels of  satisfaction with the availability of  education for children, especially 
girls. This is also the area in which they report having seen the greatest improve-
ments in the last year. Satisfaction with the availability of  water for drinking and 
irrigation and clinics and hospitals also remains relatively high. 
Survey responses in 2009 suggest there have been some improvements in electricity 
supply in the last year.  Although a third of  respondents report that they have no ac-
cess to any kind of  electricity, this figure is significantly lower than in previous years. 
While there has been no substantial increase in coverage of  the state electricity sup-
ply since 2006, there has been a rise in the use of  public or shared generators. A small 
proportion of  respondents also use solar power generation (4%) particularly in rural 
areas which appears to provide a cost effective solution to rural energy provision, 
particularly if  the quantity of  electricity supplied can be increased.  
Unemployment continues to be a major issue of  concern at both the national and 
local levels. Respondents are least satisfied with the availability of  jobs in their local 
area and report having seen the least improvement in the last year in employment 
opportunities.
Despite the progress identified in a number of  areas, overall assessments of  the 
availability of  basic amenities and services have not improved substantially over 
time. In fact, levels of  satisfaction have been falling since 2007 regarding the avail-
ability of  core services such as health and education, suggesting that expectations 
for improvement continue to remain ahead of  the implementation of  improvements 
themselves. 
Afghanistan in 200910
As in previous years, the majority of  respondents say that they are aware of  develop-
ment projects in their local area relating to education and reconstruction of  roads 
and bridges. Significant proportions of  respondents also mention projects related 
to drinking water supply and health care. The Afghan Government is viewed as the 
primary agency responsible for most development initiatives although foreign do-
nors are seen to play a key role in programs in the education sector, reconstruction 
in industry and electricity supply. The United States is identified as the major donor 
in all regions followed by Germany, Japan and India. However, a number of  other 
donors are mentioned by a significant proportion of  respondents in regions where 
they are particularly active.
In 2009, assessments of  the performance of  the national government have risen 
slightly since 2008. As in previous years, the government’s performance is judged 
most positively with regard to the provision of  education, the healthcare system 
and security, but least positively in terms of  creating jobs, reviving/developing the 
economy and fighting corruption. This year respondent’s were asked for the first 
time to identify the greatest achievements and failings of  the current government. 
The results closely mirror assessments of  the overall direction and progress of  the 
country suggesting that perceptions of  government performance are largely indis-
tinguishable from perceptions of  the state of  the country as a whole. The most 
commonly mentioned achievements of  the current government include reconstruc-
tion, establishing peace and security and a better education system, whereas the most 
commonly mentioned failings include insecurity, administrative corruption, lack of  
job opportunities, weak economy and weak government. Weak government appears 
most strongly correlated with poor security, but also, with assessments of  govern-
ment performance in the provision of  basic public services. 
The majority of  respondents continue to say that corruption is a major problem in 
all facets of  life and at all levels of  government. The proportion of  respondents that 
identify corruption as a major problem in their provincial government has fallen 
since 2006. There has also been a consistent fall in the proportion who report an an-
nual increase in corruption at this level. However, those who identify corruption as 
a major problem in their daily life and in their neighborhood has been rising steadily 
over the same period. 
Overall confidence in representative bodies and their responsiveness to addressing 
issues of  local concerns remains relatively high. The majority of  respondents say 
that both the Parliament and their own MPs are addressing the issues of  concern, 
and satisfaction with the performance of  MPs in this regards show a small improve-
ment in 2009 compared to 2008. 
Afghanistan in 2009 11
At the local level, respondents give the most positive assessment of  the performance 
of  Provincial Councils followed by district authorities and municipalities. Provincial 
Councils continue to enjoy a higher level of  public confidence than national level 
representative institutions. However, confidence in Provincial Councils has been fall-
ing consistently since 2007. In 2009, satisfaction with the performance of  municipal 
authorities increased while satisfaction with Provincial Councils and District authori-
ties has remained stable. 
In 2009, awareness of  Community Development Councils (CDC) as representative 
bodies at the village level has continued to rise. In addition, more than three quarters 
of  respondents are satisfied with the performance of  their local CDC and these bod-
ies continue to enjoy the highest levels of  public confidence of  any formal local gov-
ernance body. However, in 2009 respondents make a much clearer distinction about 
the representative role of  CDCs at different levels of  government than they have in 
the past. CDCs are judged significantly more capable to represent local interests at 
the provincial level than at the national level.  
Local shura or jirga also remain important informal governance structures at the 
local level. Respondents continue to prefer shura and jirga to state courts for de-
livering justice and resolving disputes, particularly in rural areas. Both mechanisms 
are judged most positively in terms of  accessibility although State courts are clearly 
more accessible to respondents in urban areas and those with higher levels of  edu-
cation. Since 2007, the proportion of  respondents who have taken cases to shura 
and jirga has risen whereas those taking cases to state courts has fallen. However, 
satisfaction with shura/jirga continues to drop. In 2009, the difference in levels of  
satisfaction between the outcomes of  cases taken to formal and informal dispute 
resolution mechanisms is much smaller than in previous years. Similarly, although 
public confidence in shura and jirga is higher than for all formal local governance 
bodies this has also been falling steadily since 2007.
In 2009, a significantly higher proportion of  respondents mention freedom and 
peace as the greatest personal benefits they expect from democracy than in previous 
years.  Indeed, in 2009 people appear to give greater importance to core democratic 
values such as rights and law, women’s rights, government of  the people and Islamic 
democracy, reversing the trend of  the last few years. However, they show less confi-
dence in the likelihood of  democracy delivering more tangible benefits such as less 
corruption or prosperity. 
However, since 2006, there has been a steady fall in the proportion of  respondents 
who say they are satisfied with the way democracy is working in Afghanistan. This 
Afghanistan in 200912
has been accompanied by a drop in the proportion of  respondents who agree that 
democracy is the best form of  government available. This disenchantment with de-
mocracy seems to be related to the perceived inability of  the democratic system to 
fulfill the expectations of  Afghan citizens in delivering the desired benefits.  
In 2009, stated support for core democratic values such as equal rights before the 
law and equality of  representation from all major regions and ethnic groups remains 
high. However, agreement with the principle of  equal rights continues to fall over 
time. Support for the principle of  peaceful opposition is also high, although this too 
has been falling steadily. Similarly, acceptance of  differences in political allegiances 
between individuals reached its lowest level to date in 2009. On the other hand, 
support for allowing opposition parties, including unpopular parties, to hold local 
meetings rose significantly. This may be due to the elections scheduled for 2009 
which gave greater salience to the activities of  political parties. 
As an election year, 2009 saw a certain renewed confidence in the electoral process. 
More respondents say they believe that voting can lead to improvement, reversing 
the declining trend of  the last two years. This is accompanied by a steady rise in 
the proportion of  respondents who say they can have some degree of  influence 
over government decisions, although the proportion who say they can have a lot of  
influence was much higher in 2008. Confidence in personal efficacy rises with level 
of  education and remains higher amongst urban residents although there is no sig-
nificant difference between men and women in their perceptions of  their ability to 
influence government decisions. 
The survey was conducted in June 2009 with the Presidential and Provincial Coun-
cil elections scheduled for August. Two months before the elections more than 
four-fifths of  respondents were aware of  the elections and over three quarters had reg-
istered to vote. Voter registration was significantly higher amongst men than women. 
Around three-quarters of  those who had not registered said they did not know where 
to do this, suggesting that a lack of  information about electoral procedures may still 
constitute a significant reason why Afghans may have failed to register to vote. 
Around three-quarters of  registered voters said they intended to vote, although there 
were some significant differences between regions and population groups. More men 
than women said they were likely to vote. While more than four-fifths of  registered 
voters intended to vote in the Central/Hazarajat, East, North East and North West, 
between a third and a quarter said they were unlikely to vote in the South West, 
South East, West and Central/Kabul regions. Security concerns were prevalent in 
the South East and South West. Social restrictions that limit the electoral participa-
Afghanistan in 2009 13
tion of  women were significant in the Central/Kabul and North East regions. The 
proportion of  respondents who report having no interest in participating in the elec-
tions rose sharply in 2009, and has more than doubled since 2004.  Voting intention 
is strongly correlated with the sense of  personal efficacy, suggesting that people are 
more likely to use their voting rights if  they believe that voting can lead to improve-
ment. Voting intention is also strongly correlated with confidence in the integrity of  
the electoral process. 
The majority of  respondents said that the upcoming elections would be free and 
fair.  Those who thought otherwise identified a range of  potential problems in-
cluding cheating in the vote count and buying of  votes. Only a small proportion 
mentioned intimidation against voters or party activists. Doubts about the elections 
being free and fair were highest in the South West, South East, West and Central/
Kabul regions. However, despite some doubts about the electoral process, 2009 saw 
a significant rise in public confidence in a number of  election-related institutions in-
cluding the Independent Election Commission and political parties, which achieved 
the highest level of  public confidence since 2006.
Views on freedom of  expression continue to be divided. Physical security condi-
tions, as well as the legal guarantee of  freedoms, again emerge as the key elements 
in ensuring freedom of  expression for citizens. The proportion of  respondents who 
say it is unacceptable to talk negatively about the government continues to fall, dem-
onstrating that the major obstacles to freedom of  expression in Afghanistan do not 
come from the government but from other factors in the environment and society. 
Support for consultation with religious leaders in government decision-making and 
to resolve local problems continues to rise, with highest levels of  support in the East 
(82%) and South West (72%) of  the country 
As in previous years, education and illiteracy (49%) remain the major problems fac-
ing women in Afghanistan. However, over the same period there has been a con-
sistent rise in the proportion of  respondents who identify the lack of  employment 
opportunities for women as a significant issue.
Stated support for gender equality, such as equal educational opportunities and wom-
en’s right to vote, remains high. However, the proportion of  respondents who say 
that women should be allowed to work outside the home has decreased marginally 
each year to its lowest level in 2009. Despite the high level of  support for women’s 
electoral participation only a small majority think that women should decide for 
themselves how to vote. In the South West and South East significant proportions of  
respondents say it is acceptable for men to vote in the place of  women. As in previ-
Afghanistan in 200914
ous years, support for the principles of  gender equality is higher amongst women, 
younger age groups and urban residents. Support also rises with level of  education.
Results in 2009 show a significant decline in support for female representation in 
governance institutions at all levels compared to previous years. Respondents record 
the least opposition to being represented by a woman in their District Development 
Assembly (DDA). Women continue to have a much stronger belief  in equality of  
representation than men.  
Radio remains the most accessible media for Afghan households particularly in rural 
areas. However, there has been a steady decline in radio ownership and radio listen-
ership since 2007. Television ownership continues to rise although it remains much 
more common in urban areas. In addition, 2009 saw a significant rise in mobile 
telephone ownership compared to previous years, meaning that for the first time the 
majority of  respondents now have access to this technology.
However, the use of  informal networks as a source of  news and information re-
mains high. Nearly half  of  respondent use meetings in the community or sermons 
in mosques for this purpose. Recourse to informal networks such as friends, family 
and neighbors as the principle source of  information also remains high, particularly 
in rural areas and for women and respondents with lower levels of  education. How-
ever, the proportion of  respondents who say they prefer to receive information on 
local events from personal acquaintances has been falling steadily in recent years. On 
the other hand, 2009 records the highest proportion of  respondents who say they 
prefer to get information from influential people such as village chiefs, community 
leaders or mullahs, demonstrating that traditional channels of  information dissemi-
nation continue to remain important in Afghanistan.
The National Mood 15
2 The National Mood
2.1 Direction of the country
For the fourth year running the survey sought to gauge how the men and women 
of  Afghanistan assess their country’s overall situation. Respondents were first asked 
whether they think the country is moving in the right direction or the wrong direc-
tion. The most common view, held by 42 percent of  respondents, is that the country 
is moving in the right direction. However, a sizeable proportion (29%) say it is mov-
ing in the wrong direction. About one in five respondents (21%) has mixed views on 
the overall direction of  the country.  
Interestingly, households with lower incomes are more likely to say that the country 
is moving in the right direction than those with high incomes. Over half  (51%) of  
households in the lowest income category say this compared to 38 percent in the 
highest earning bracket. Similarly, around a third (34%) of  those in the high income 
categories say that the country is moving in the wrong direction compared with a 
quarter (25%) in the lowest group. 
There are also significant differences in opinion between regions. The majority of  
people living in the East (58%), North East (54%) and North West (55%) are opti-
mistic about the overall direction of  the country. In contrast, a significant proportion 
of  the population in the South West (42%), South East (40%) and Central/Kabul 
(35%) regions feel that the country is moving in the wrong direction.  
The proportion of  respondents saying that the country is moving in the right direc-
tion in 2009 (42%) is higher than the figure recorded in 2008 (38%), signaling a check 
on the trend of  declining optimism that had been evident since 2006. Similarly, in 
2009 only 29 percent feel that the country is moving in the wrong direction com-
pared to 32 percent who felt so in 2008. This figure is still higher than in 2007 (24%) 
and 2006 (21%). The proportion of  those with mixed views continues to fall (from 
29% in 2006 to 21% in 2009).

2.2 Reasons for optimism
Respondents who say that things are moving in the right direction (42% of  all re-
spondents) were then asked to give the two most important reasons why they think 
this is so. The most commonly mentioned reasons include good security (44%), re-
construction/rebuilding (36%) and opening of  schools for girls (21%). Around one 
in ten respondents mention good government (12%) and democracy and elections 
(10%) as factors for optimism. Improvements in security are more often mentioned 
by respondents in urban (49%) than rural (42%) areas. Households in the lowest 
income bracket most often mention improvements in security (51%), but least often 
mention reconstruction and rebuilding (29%). The opening of  schools for girls is 
emphasized more by women (23%) than men (19%).

Across the country good security is the most frequently cited reason why the country 
is moving in the right direction in the North East (63%), North West (60%), Cen-
tral/Hazarajat (53%) and East (39%) regions2. 
Reconstruction/rebuilding is given as the main reason in the Central/Kabul (45%), 
South East (41%) and South West (35%). In the West respondents give equal impor-
tance to security (31%) and reconstruction (30%).

Between 2006 and 2009, good security has almost consistently been identified as the 
most important reason why respondents say that the country is heading in the right 
direction. Only in 2007 did most respondents identify reconstruction as the primary 
reason for optimism. In addition, the proportion of  people mentioning good secu-
rity has been rising, steadily from 31 percent in 2006 to 44 percent in 2009. The pro-
portion mentioning reconstruction/rebuilding and the opening of  school for girls 
has also generally been rising although the impact of  rebuilding and reconstruction 
was most strongly marked between 2006 and 2007. The proportion of  respondents 
mentioning economic revival or democracy and elections has been relatively stable 
over this period. On the other hand, factors such as the end of  the war which were 
salient in 2006 when they were mentioned by 29 percent of  respondents are much 
less relevant in 2009 (9%).  
2  It should be considered that in 2009 survey researchers faced much greater restrictions on their move-
ments due to security concerns than in previous years. For the 2009 survey, more than 100 randomly 
selected sampling points across the country were inaccessible due to security reasons (see Appendix 2: 
Methodology).

2.3 Reasons for pessimism
Respondents who say that things are moving in the wrong direction (i.e. 29% of  all 
respondents) were also asked to give the two main reasons for their view. Insecurity 
is cited by 42 percent of  respondents, making it by far the most important reason 
for pessimism. One-fourth (25%) of  respondents identify bad government as the 
reason for pessimism, followed by corruption (17%) and unemployment (15%).

There is also some variation between regions in the reasons cited for believing that the 
country is moving in the wrong direction. Insecurity remains the most common reason 
given in almost all regions with more than 40 percent of  respondents mentioning this 
in the South West (49%), East (47%), Central Kabul (44%), South East (42%) and 
The National Mood 19
West (42%). Suicide attacks are particularly singled out by almost one in five respon-
dents in the East (19%) and one in ten in the North West (9%), which is much higher 
than in other parts of  the country. Bad government is the most commonly cited rea-
son in the Central Hazarajat (31%) and ranks in second place in all the other regions. 
The absence of  reconstruction is mentioned by nearly twice as many respondents in 
the North East (13%) and Central Hazarajat (10%) as in other parts of  the country.

2009 is the third consecutive year that insecurity has emerged as the major reason 
respondents say the country is moving in the wrong direction. This indicates that se-
curity continues to remain a key concern for Afghans and a critical factor by which 
they judge the progress and direction of  their country’s development. However, the 
proportion of  respondents highlighting insecurity in 2009 (42%) has fallen since 
2008 when half  of  respondents (50%) emphasized this factor. On the other hand, 
the proportion of  respondents mentioning bad government (25%) has more than 
doubled since 2008 (12%) and remains higher than in 2006 (22%) when it rated 
amongst the top concerns.

2.4 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: National level
The survey attempted to measure public opinion regarding the biggest problems 
facing Afghanistan as a whole. Insecurity (including attacks, violence and terrorism) 
is identified as the biggest problem in Afghanistan by over a third of  respondents 
(36%), particularly in the South East (48%), West (44%), East (31%), and South 
West (41%) regions. Unemployment is mentioned by 35 percent of  respondents and 
is identified as the biggest problem in the Central/Kabul (41%), North East (42%) 
and North West (47%) regions. Other major problems identified include the poor 
economy (20%), corruption (17%), poverty (11%) and lack of  education, schools 
and literacy (11%).

Since 2006, insecurity and unemployment have consistently been identified as the 
most important problems, followed by the poor economy and corruption. The pro-
portion of  respondents identifying insecurity as the biggest problem in Afghanistan 
in 2009 is the same as in 2008 (36%). However, the figures for those mentioning 
other major issues have all risen, including unemployment (from 31% in 2008 to 
35% in 2009), poor economy (from 17% to 20%), corruption (from 14% to 17%), 
poverty (from 8% to 11%) and education (from 9% to 11%). In contrast however, 
the proportion of  respondents mentioning the presence of  the Taliban continues to 
fall (from 18% in 2006 to 13% in 2007 and 2008 to just 8% in 2009).

2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: Local level
The most important problems identified by respondents at the local level are quite dif-
ferent from those mentioned at the national level. The survey asked respondents about 
the biggest problem in their local area and invited them to mention two. As in previous 
years, across the country as a whole it is development issues, rather than security or 
governance issues, that dominate priorities at the local level. The problems most often 
mentioned by respondents are unemployment (26%) and electricity (26%), followed by 
lack of  roads (24%), water (22%) and lack of  health care/clinics/hospitals (20%). 
Unemployment is identified as a significant problem at both national and local 
levels. More than a third (35%) of  respondents identify unemployment among the 
top two problems at the national level and around a quarter (26%) say the same at 
the local level.

Lack of  electricity is most frequently identified as the main local problem in the 
East (36%), North East (35%) and North West (33%) regions, while over a quarter 
of  respondents in every region, except the North West, mention unemployment as 
the local biggest problem. Insecurity, attacks and violence are much more frequently 
mentioned in the South East (28%), South West (25%) and West (20%) than in other 
parts of  the country (between 5% and 9%). Lack of  roads is mentioned by around 
a third of  respondents in the Central/Kabul (32%), North East (32%) and North 
West (29%) regions, while water is identified as the main problem in the North West 
(41%) and Central/Hazarajat (29%).

The National Mood 23
Twice as many respondents in rural areas (17%) mention education as one of  the 
biggest local problems as compared to those in urban areas (8%). The same is true 
for insecurity, attacks and violence which are mentioned by 15 percent of  respon-
dents in villages compared to 8 percent of  those in urban areas. Electricity is also 
slightly more often mentioned by rural (27%) than urban (23%) respondents. On the 
other hand, roads are more often cited by respondents in urban areas (30%) than in 
villages (22%), and the same is true for health care (25% of  urban compared to 19% 
of  rural respondents).
Despite occasional fluctuations, the identification of  major local problems has re-
mained relatively stable since 2006. However, the priority of  roads appears to be 
rising (24% in 2009 compared to 18% in 2008, 19% in 2007 and 14% in 2006), and 
the same is true for healthcare, although to a more limited extent (from 15% in 2006 
and 2008 to 20% in 2009).

2.6 Confidence in specific institutions and organizations
Confidence in public institutions and organizations represents an important indica-
tor of  public trust in government and other social institutions. Respondents were 
asked about the confidence they have in a range of  public institutions and organiza-
tions. A list was read out and respondents were asked to state how much confidence 
Afghanistan in 200924
they have in each body to perform its job. Responses indicate that the highest levels 
of  public confidence are still enjoyed by the Afghan National Army (ANA) (91%) 
and the Afghan National Police (ANP) (84%). Since 2006 these two institutions 
have consistently enjoyed the highest levels of  public confidence. Confidence in the 
ANA, in particular, has even risen slightly over this period.
Representative bodies enjoy the confidence of  around two thirds of  respondents 
including community shura and jirga (68%), Community Development Councils 
(CDC) (63%) and Provincial Councils (62%). While confidence in CDCs has re-
mained stable since 2007, confidence in Provincial Councils has fallen (from 69% in 
2007 to 65% in 2008 and 62% in 2009). The same trend is evident regarding confi-
dence in community shura and jirga which has fallen from 71 percent in 2007 to 69 
percent in 2008 and 68 percent in 2009.
Confidence in the media is also high. Seventy percent of  respondents say they have 
confidence in electronic media such as radio and television. However, here too con-
fidence levels have been falling since 2006 when the figure was 84 percent. Sixty-two 
percent say they have confidence in newspapers and print media. Considerable pub-
lic confidence is also expressed in non-governmental organizations, both interna-
tional (66%) and national (62%) as has been the case since 2007.
Respondents show greater ambivalence towards government institutions. Only 57 
percent express confidence in the public administration. This falls to 46 percent for 
the government justice system and 46 percent for municipalities. A little more than 
half  of  respondents (53%) say they have confidence in government ministers. How-
ever, two-thirds (67%) of  respondents say they have confidence in the Independent 
Election Commission. This is a significant increase since 2008 (57%) which may be 
due to the higher public profile of  the Commission in the run up to the 2009 presi-
dential and provincial elections.
Although public confidence in political parties remains low (47%), the figure re-
corded in 2009 is the highest since 2006. This may also be related to the increased 
activity of  political parties in an election year. Public confidence is again lowest for 
local militias, with just over one-third of  respondents (37%) expressing confidence 
in them. However, this figure has been steadily rising since 2006 (from 31% to 33% 
in 2007 and 36% in 2008).

3.1 Security Situation
Although respondents identify insecurity as the biggest problem facing the country 
(see Chapter 2, 2.4 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: National level), in most places it is not 
identified as the biggest problem at the local level (see Chapter 2, 2.5 Afghanistan’s 
biggest problems: Local level). When asked about the security situation in the village/
neighborhood where they live, a majority of  respondents (64%) say that it is quite 
good or very good in their area3.  
Bearing this caveat in mind, the situation still appears to vary significantly between 
regions. The majority of  respondents have a positive perception of  the security situ-
ation in their local area in the North West (86%), Central/Kabul (78%), Central/
Hazarajat (77%), North East (76%) and East (70%).  On the other hand, more than 
half  of  respondents say that security in their local area is quite bad or very bad in the 
West (55%), South East (62%), and South West (65%) regions.

Trends show that since 2006 the large majority of  respondents in the North West, 
North East, Central/Kabul and Central/Hazarajat regions continue to say their lo-
cal security situation is good, whereas in the South East the majority continue to say 
3  It should be considered that in 2009 survey researchers faced much greater restrictions on their move-
ments due to security concerns than in previous years. For the 2009 survey, more than 100 randomly 
selected sampling points across the country were inaccessible due to security reasons (see Appendix 2: 
Methodology).

situation since 2006 in the East and North West, the situation has deteriorated sig-
nificantly in the South West and West.

Respondents from rural and urban areas have significantly different perceptions of  
local security. A higher proportion of  urban residents (79%) say the security situation 
in their local area is either quite good or very good compared to their rural counter-
parts (60%). On the other hand, more than a third of  respondents in rural areas (39%) 
say security in their local area is quite bad or very bad compared to only one-fifth of  
urban residents (20%). This is consistent with the finding that nearly twice as many 
rural residents identify insecurity as one of  the biggest local problems compared to 
those in urban areas (see Chapter 2, 2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: Local level).

3.2 Personal and family safety and security
The survey sought to gauge the perception of  safety and security for individuals and 
their families. About a third of  respondents (32%) report that they never fear for 
their personal safety or for that of  their families. However, another third (35%) say 
that they sometimes fear for their safety and 16 percent say they often do.
The proportion of  respondents who say they often fear for their safety has been ris-
ing steadily over the last four years (from 9% in 2006 to 11% in 2007, 15% in 2008 
and 16% in 2009).

The proportion of  respondents who report never having any fear is highest in the 
Central/Kabul, North East, North West and Central/Hazarajat regions. These find-
ings show how the people living in regions where the local security situation is good 
are generally less fearful for their own personal safety, or for that of  their families. 
Conversely, the degree of  fear is more pronounced in the regions where insecurity is 
identified as an important local problem such as the South East (65%), West (62%) 
and South West (62%), where around two-thirds of  respondents say they sometimes 
or often fear for their safety (see Chapter 2, 2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: Local level).

The survey also attempted to examine people’s actual experience of  violence and 
crime by asking whether they, or anyone in their family, have been a victim of  vio-
lence or some criminal act in their home or community in the past year. Compared 
to the relatively high proportion of  people who report that they sometimes or often 
fear for their safety (51%), the proportion of  those who have actually experienced 
violence or crime in the past year is relatively low, although it is still significant. 
Nearly one in six respondents (17%) report that they or someone in their family have 
been victims of  violence or crime in the past year.
The experience of  violence or crime is almost twice as high in rural (19%) as in 
urban (10%) areas. This is consistent with the greater concern about insecurity re-
ported by rural respondents (see Fig.3.2).  Income also seems to have some bearing 
on victimization from violence or crime. The proportion of  respondents who report 
having been victims of  violence or crime rises consistently with monthly household 
income, from 12 percent of  those earning less than 2000Afs a month to 20 percent 
amongst those earning more than 10,000Afs. 
There is also variation between regions. The highest incidence of  crime or violence 
is reported by respondents in the South East (26%), followed by the West (25%), 
South West (25%) and East (22%). In addition, the experience of  violence or crime 
has increased significantly in most of  these regions since 2008, (In the South East 
from 21% to 26%, in the East from 19% to 22%, and in the West from 17% to 25%). 
This is again consistent with the higher perceptions of  insecurity and the identifica-
tion of  insecurity as a major local problem in these regions (see Fig.3.1). There has 
also been an increase in victimization in the Central/Hazarajat region since 2008 
(from 4% to 10%), although the level still remains relatively low.

When respondents who report having been a victim of  violence or crime in the past 
year (17% of  all respondents) were asked about the kinds of  violence and crime they 
had experienced, the most commonly mentioned include physical attack or beating 
(30%), racketeering/extortion (15%) and property-related crime such as burglary/
looting (15%) and theft of  livestock (10%). Nearly one in ten victims of  violence 
report that these were due to military style actions with equal proportions identifying 
the actions of  militias and insurgents (9%) and those of  foreign forces (9%). The 
incidence of  victimization from military type actions has been rising steadily both 
for militia/insurgent activity (from 3% in 2007 to 8% in 2008 and 9% in 2009) and 
the actions of  foreign forces (from 5% in 2007 to 6% in 2008 and 9% in 2009), indi-
cating that the ongoing hostilities continue to have a perceptible impact on the lives 
of  the Afghan people. Indeed, violence resulting from militant/insurgent actions is 
mentioned by a relatively high number of  people in the Central/Kabul (11%), and 
East (17%) and in the Central/Hazarajat (24%) where it is one of  the types of  vio-
lence most often mentioned by respondents. Violence resulting from the actions of  
foreign forces is mentioned by one in five victims (22%) in the South West region, 
and by one in ten in the South East (11%) and the East (10%). Analysis of  responses 
in individual provinces gives an even starker picture. At least one in four victims 
report having experienced militia or insurgent related violence in Kapisa (27%), Pak-
tika (26%), Daikundi (26%) and Kunar (25%) provinces. One in five victims (20%) 
in Kunar also report having experienced violence from the actions of  foreign forces. 
This is also true of  more than a third of  victims of  violence in Uruzgan (38%) and 
half  the victims (50%) in Zabul province.

3.3 Attitude towards reporting crime
Those respondents who have been a victim or violence or crime (17% of  all respon-
dents) were then asked whether they reported the crime to any authority. Just under 
two-thirds (61%) say they reported the crime, while another third say they did not. 
Reporting levels have not changed since 2007. Rural dwellers are more likely to re-
Security 33
port crime to an authority (62%) than their urban counterparts (56%). The survey also 
found that respondents with higher educational levels are more likely to report crime 
than those who never went to school (58% of  crime victims who never went to school 
reported the crime compared to 71% of  those with secondary or higher education).
Reporting of  crime is highest in the North East (70%), followed by the Central/
Hazarajat (67%), East (64%) and West (63%). Reporting of  crime is lowest in the 
South West (54%). 
Respondents who say they reported violence or crime (10% of  all respondents) were 
also asked to which agency or institution they reported the crime. Multiple responses 
were possible. The majority of  respondents say they reported the crime to govern-
ment authorities such as the Afghanistan National Police (ANP) (41%) or the district 
governor/woleswal (23%). Around one in five (18%) reported the incident to the 
Afghan National Army (ANA). A significant proportion say they reported the crime 
to informal or traditional institutions such as tribal leaders or maliks (18%), shura/
elders (12%) or mullahs (6%). 
There is a significant distinction in the choice of  authority to which crime is reported 
between rural and urban areas. Respondents in urban areas are more likely to report 
a crime to formal institutions such as the ANP (64%) than those in rural areas (38%). 
On the other hand, rural respondents are more likely to report a crime to traditional 
institutions such as shura/elders (14%) than those in urban areas (4%). The district 
governor’s office is also a popular place for rural residents to report crimes.

Respondents, who have been victims of  crime or violence, but who did not report 
this to any authority (i.e., 6% of  all respondents), were asked to give the reasons for 
not reporting the crime. Again, multiple responses were possible. Around a quarter 
(23%) say they did not report because it makes no difference. A similar proportion 
(22%) say they were afraid of  retaliation. Women are particularly deterred from re-
porting crime by danger or fear of  retaliation (24% compared to 20% of  men). This 
is also a more significant factor for respondents in urban areas (32%) as compared 
to those in rural areas (20%). Danger or fear of  retaliation is particularly pronounced 
in the North East (34%), West (28%), Central/Hazarajat (28%) and Central/Kabul 
(24%) regions.
One in five (20%) say the incident was not serious enough to warrant reporting. A 
significant proportion (14%) mention lack of  trust in government officials as the 
reason for not reporting crime. However, this is much more commonly cited as a 
reason in rural (15%) than urban (5%) areas. Around one in ten (11%) respondents 
say they did not report the crime because they didn’t know where to report it. This 
figure was slightly higher in urban (13%) than rural (11%) areas. Those saying they 
did not know where to report crime was particularly high in the North West (19%), 
Central/Kabul (17%), East (13%) and North East (13%) regions.

All respondents, regardless of  whether they have had personal experience of  crime 
or not, were asked the hypothetical question: “If  you were a witness to a crime, to 
whom would you report it?” Again, multiple responses were possible. Almost half  
of  respondents (48%) say they would report a crime to ANP. Other government 
Security 35
institutions such as the ANA (16%) and district governor/woleswal (15%) are also 
identified frequently. However, as with the actual reporting of  crime, a significant 
number of  people say that they would report to informal or traditional institutions 
such as tribal leaders or maliks (23%), shura or elders (13%) and mullahs (10%). 
Again, informal institutions are more often mentioned in rural than in urban areas. 
This finding closely mirrors those of  previous years
Responses to the hypothetical question about reporting of  crime largely correspond 
to the actual reporting of  crime. However, there is a tendency to overestimate the 
importance of  the ANP as the authority to which crime is reported. About half  of  
respondents (48%) say they would report a crime they witnessed to the ANP, but 
only 41 percent of  victims actually reported the crime to the ANP. The same holds 
true in the case of  tribal leaders or maliks (23% say they would report to them but 
18% actually did so) and mullah sahibs (10% say they would report to them, 6% 
actually did). On the other hand, 15 percent say that they would report a crime they 
witnessed to a district governor or woleswal, but in fact, 23 percent of  victims actu-
ally reported the crime to a District Governor.

3.4 Causes of crime
The survey also attempted to identify what people think are the biggest cause of  
crime in Afghanistan. Respondents were requested to mention up to two causes. 
The most common cause of  crime respondents mention is unemployment (37%). 
Sizeable numbers of  respondents also identify corruption (22%), poverty (22%), 
insecurity (21%), illiteracy (16%) and weak government (12%) as amongst the big-
gest cause of  crime. 
Afghanistan in 200936
In addition to these main causes, a number of  other issues were highlighted in spe-
cific regions where they have a particular impact. These include drugs (10%), partic-
ularly mentioned in the North East (15%) and West (13%), and the presence of  the 
Taliban (8%), which is most often mentioned in the East (15%), South West (12%) 
and Central/Hazarajat (12%). Interference from Pakistan (3%) is particularly men-
tioned in the South West (7%), whereas the presence of  international forces (2%) is 
most often mentioned in the East (7%) and the South West (5%).

3.5 Safety to participate in various activities
The survey also examined perceptions of  security by ascertaining whether people 
feel safe to participate in a range of  public activities. A series of  activities was read-
out to respondents and they were asked to say whether they would participate in 
these activities with some degree of  fear or without fear. The majority of  respondents 
(57%) say they would have no fear participating in resolving problems at the commu-
nity level. However, this is not the case with other forms of  public activity. Just over 
half  (51%) of  respondents said they would be afraid to vote in a national election, 
including 16 percent who say they would have a lot of  fear doing this. In contrast, a 
significant majority say they would have some degree of  fear engaging in public po-
litical actions such as participating in a peaceful demonstration (61%) or running for 
public office (58%). More than two-thirds of  respondents (69%) also say they would 
be afraid when traveling from one part of  the country to another. Half  (50%) of  
respondents say that they would have some fear encountering officers of  the Afghan 
National Police (ANP). These figures closely match those recorded in 2008.

There are important variations between regions. The highest levels of  fear to partici-
pate in any kind of  public activity are recorded in the South West region, followed by 
the West, South East and East which are also the regions where respondents most 
frequently say they fear for their safety and that of  their families (see Fig.3.4) and 
where insecurity is identified as one of  the biggest problems at the local level (see 
Chapter 2, 2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: Local level). More than half  of  respondents 
say they would have some fear participating in resolving problems in their local com-
munities in the South West (62%) and West (54%) regions. The majority say the same 
about voting in a national election in the South West (79%), South East (68%), West 
(61%) and East (56%). This clearly reflects the impact of  insecurity on democratic 
participation in these regions.

More women report fear participating in public activities than men. Just under half  
(46%) of  women say they would have some fear participating in resolving problems 
in the community, compared to around a third (34%) of  men. Women also express 
more fear voting in a national election (55% compared to 48% of  men) and par-
ticipating in a peaceful demonstration (64% compared to 58% of  men). However, 
there is no significant difference in the proportions of  men and women who say they 
would have fear running for public office or traveling around the country. 
Since 2006, the proportion of  respondents who say they would have some fear par-
ticipating in resolving problems in their community has risen. The same is true for 
voting in a national election or running for public office.

The proportion of  respondents who express fear to vote rose significantly between 
2008 and 2009 (from 45% to 51%). The rise is evident in all regions, but particularly 
noticeable in the West (from 47% to 61%) and North East (from 39% to 46%).

3.6 Perceptions of the Afghan National Police
The most important institution in Afghanistan with responsibility for ensuring secu-
rity and fighting crime and violence is the Afghan National Police (ANP). The survey 
sought to examine public perceptions of  the effectiveness of  the ANP in combating 
crime and improving security. It also sought to assess the levels of  trust respondents 
have in the police in terms of  honesty and fairness, professionalism and the capac-
ity to act without the assistance of  foreign troops. A series of  statements about the 
ANP was read out to respondents and they were asked to state whether they agree or 
disagree. The responses to these statements are summarized in the table below.

e) ANP is efficient at arresting those who have com-
mitted crimes so that they can be brought to justice 34 37 18 8
Afghanistan in 200940
Overall, respondents assess the ANP favorably. More than four out of  five respon-
dents agree that the ANP is honest and fair with the Afghan people (83%) and helps 
improve security (82%). Nearly three-quarters (71%) believe that the ANP is effi-
cient at arresting those who have committed crimes so they can be brought to justice. 
However, an equally high proportion (70%) agree that the ANP needs the support 
of  foreign troops and cannot operate by itself. Over half  (58%) think that the ANP 
is unprofessional and poorly trained. 
Perceptions of  the operational capacity of  the ANP have been improving since 
2007. Fewer respondents now think that the ANP is unprofessional and poorly 
trained (58% in 2009 compared to 65% in 2007) or that it needs the support of  
foreign troops to operate (70% in 2009 compared to 77% in 2007). However, this 
does not translate into greater satisfaction with police performance. Slightly fewer 
respondents in 2009 agree that the ANP helps to improve security (82% in 2009 
compared to 86% in 2007), or that it is honest and fair (83% in 2009 compared to 
86% in 2007).

3.7 Perceptions of the Afghan National Army
The survey also attempted to gauge public perceptions of  the other most significant 
national security force, the Afghan National Army (ANA). A similar series of  state-
ments about the ANA was read out to respondents and they were asked to indicate 
whether they agree or disagree. The responses to these statements are summarized 
in the table below.

d) ANA helps improve the security 54 33 8 3
Overall, the public has an even more positive perception of  the ANA than it does 
of  the ANP. Nine out of  ten respondents (91%) agree that the ANA is honest and 
fair with the Afghan people as compared to eight out of  ten (83%) who say the same 
about the ANP. A similarly high proportion agree that the ANA is helping to im-
prove the security situation in the country (87%) as compared to 82 percent for the 
ANP. These responses are consistent with the finding that the Afghan National Po-
lice and the Afghan National Army enjoy the highest levels of  confidence amongst 
public institutions in Afghanistan (see Chapter 2, Table 2.3).
However, respondents also register similar concerns about the capacity of  the ANA 
to operate, as they do for the ANP. More than two thirds (69%) agree that the ANA 
cannot operate without the support of  foreign troops. Around half  (52%) agree that 
the ANA is unprofessional and poorly trained. 
As with the ANP, perceptions of  the operational capacity of  the ANA are also rising 
over time. Fewer respondents now say that the ANA is unprofessional and poorly 
trained (52% in 2009 compared to 62% in 2007), or that it needs the support of  for-
eign troops to operate (69% in 2009 compared to 77% in 2007). However, percep-
tions of  the ANA’s performance remain stable.

3.8 Expectations regarding security
The survey also aimed to examine public expectations regarding the security situa-
tion in the future. Respondents were asked how they expect the security situation in 
their local area to be in a year’s time. Overall, the majority of  respondents (75%) are 
optimistic. Nearly half  (46%) say they expect it will be much better and just under 
a third (29%) say that it will be somewhat better. There are, however, significant 
variations between regions.  More than half  of  respondents in the South West (51%) 
think that the security situation will be worse in a year from now. This is true for 41 
percent in the South East and at least one-fifth of  respondents in the East (23%). 
The results suggest that in these regions where insecurity is a major problem respon-
dents are much less optimistic about future improvements.  
What is your expectation for the security situation in your area a year from now – much better, 
somewhat better, somewhat worse or much worse? (Q-17e, Base 6406) BY REGION

Economy and Development 43
4 Economy and Development
4.1 Economy of Afghan Households: Past and present
The survey sought to ascertain how people perceive their level of  economic well 
being. Respondents were asked to assess their current level of  economic prosperity 
compared to different periods in the past. They were first asked to compare their 
current economic condition with their circumstances under the Taliban Government 
(1996-2001). Around half  (54%) of  respondents report that their families are more 
prosperous today than they were during the days of  the Taliban regime. One-fourth 
(24%) say that they are now less prosperous. Fourteen percent say their economic 
circumstances are the same, while the remainder were absent during Taliban rule.  
The proportion of  respondents who say they are more prosperous is the highest since 
2006 (when it was also 54%). The more positive assessment of  family economic pros-
perity in 2009 may be correlated with the increase in the proportion of  people who 
say that things are going in the right direction since 2008 (see Chapter 2, 2.1 Direction of  
the country). It may also be related to the fact that fewer people in 2009 identify high 
prices as one of  the biggest national problems compared to 2008 when this appeared 
as a major issue (see Chapter 2, 2.4 Afghanistan’s biggest problem: National level). 
If  you think about your family, would you say that today your family is more prosperous, less 
prosperous, or about as prosperous as under the Taliban government? (Q-38) COMPARISON

Urban residents have a more positive view of  their family’s current economic pros-
perity than their rural counterparts. Just under two thirds (63%) of  urban dwellers 
think that they are more prosperous today than they were under the Taliban regime, 
compared to just over half  (52%) of  rural residents. Compared to other communi-
ties, Pashtuns tend to have a more negative assessment of  their current level of  
economic prosperity. A little over a third of  Pashtuns (39%) think that they are more 
prosperous today than under Taliban rule, compared to nearly two thirds for most 
other groups.

There are also significant differences in perceptions of  current economic prosperity 
between regions. Fewer than one in five respondents in the South West (18%) and 
just over one in three of  respondents in the South East (36%) feel that they are more 
prosperous today then they were under the Taliban regime, compared to at least 
half  of  respondents in the other regions. These two regions also record the highest 
proportion of  respondents who are pessimistic about the overall direction of  the 
country (see Chapter 2, 2.1 Direction of  the country).

The survey also asked respondents to compare their current level of  economic pros-
perity with a period further back in time during the period of  the Soviet occupation 
(1979-1989). Half  (50%) of  respondents say that their family is more prosperous 
now than during the period of  the Soviet occupation. Another third (32%) say that 
they are now less prosperous than during the Soviet period while 10 percent say that 
their circumstances are about the same. 
Now, going even further back to the period of  the Soviet occupation, if  you think about your family 
then and now, would you say that today your family is more prosperous, less prosperous, or about as 
prosperous as under the Soviet occupation government? (Q-39, Base 6406)

This is less than half  the figure recorded in other regions  
4.2 Economic Situation of Afghan Households
The survey also endeavored to examine the economic situation of  Afghan households 
in more detail by comparing the situation of  households today with their situation 
one year ago in terms of  financial and physical well-being, as well as access to basic 
services and amenities. The proportion of  respondents who report improvements in 
their situation during the last one year is summarized in the following table.

domains (Q-45a-h, Base 6406)

The greatest improvement has been in access to schools, mentioned by 40 percent of  
respondents. More people in urban areas (51%) report such improvements as com-
pared to their rural counterparts (37%). Improvements in access to schools are re-
ported by more than half  of  respondents in the North West (53%) and East (52%), 
and by more than a third in the Central/Kabul (44%), North East (44%), Central/
Hazarajat (37%) and South East (35%) regions. However relatively few respondents 
report improvements in the West (29%) and South West (14%) regions. 
Around one-third of  respondents report improvements in the health (32%) and 
financial well-being (31%) of  their families. Health improvements are reported most 
often in the East (47%), Central/Kabul (34%), South East (34%) and North West 
(33%) regions. However, around a quarter of  respondents in the North East (24%) 
and South West (29%) actually say that their health status has worsened during the 
last year. Improvements in financial well-being are most often reported in the East 
Economy and Development 47
(43%), South East (38%), Central/Kabul (34%) and North West (34%) regions. Not 
surprisingly, low income households are less likely to report improvements in their 
financial situation than those with higher incomes. Thirty-one percent of  house-
holds with a monthly income of  less than 2000 Afs say their financial wellbeing has 
improved in the last year compared to 36 percent of  those earning over 10,000Afs. 
Around a fifth of  respondents also mention improvements in the quality of  their diet 
(23%), electricity supply (23%) and the physical conditions of  their house/dwelling 
(20%). Improvements in electricity supply in the past year are most often mentioned 
in the Central/Kabul region (42%). 
Respondents report the least improvement in employment opportunities (11%). The 
lowest levels of  improvement in this regard are recorded in the South West (7%), 
South East (8%), West (9%) and North East (10%) regions. These responses re-
confirm the identification of  unemployment as one of  the biggest problems facing 
Afghanistan at both national and local levels (see Chapter 2, 2.4 - Afghanistan’s biggest 
problem: National level and 2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problem: Local level).
4.3 Availability of basic amenities
The survey also attempted to measure the current condition of  basic infrastructure and 
essential public services. The table below summarizes respondents’ views on the avail-
ability of  a range of  basic amenities in the villages and neighborhoods where they live.

g) The availability of  medicine 11 33 39 16
h) The availability of  education for children 25 42 22 10
Overall, respondents report the greatest satisfaction regarding the availability of  ed-
ucation for children with two-thirds (67%) saying this is quite good or very good in 
their local area. This is consistent with the finding that access to schools has shown 
the greatest improvement in the last year (see Table 4.1). A similarly high proportion 
Afghanistan in 200948
of  respondents (63%) judge the availability of  clean drinking water to be good or 
very good, and around half  say the same about water for irrigation (53%) and the 
availability of  clinic and hospitals (49%). 
On the other hand, people are least satisfied with the availability of  jobs. More than 
three quarters (76%) of  respondents say the availability of  jobs in their local area is 
quite bad or very bad. About two thirds (65%)  say the supply of  electricity in their 
local area is bad. These findings are entirely consistent with the identification of  lo-
cal problems discussed in Chapter 2 (see Chapter 2, 2.5 - Afghanistan’s biggest problem: 
Local level).
The present condition of  basic amenities varies widely between regions. The avail-
ability of  education for children is judged to be good or very good by a clear majority 
in all regions except the South West where only a third (34%) of  respondents think 
this. The availability of  jobs is judged to be bad by more than three quarters of  re-
spondents in the South West (79%), West (78%), and North East (78%), which is 
much higher than in other regions.
Despite the progress identified by respondents in a number of  areas, overall assess-
ments of  the availability of  basic amenities and services have not improved sub-
stantially over time. In fact, although the greatest progress is reported in access to 
education (see Table 4.1), the proportion of  respondents who judge this to be good 
in their local area has been falling since 2007 (from 72% to 70% in 2008 and 67% 
in 2009). The same is true for the availability of  clinics and hospitals (from 56% in 
2007 to 51% in 2008 and 49% in 2009).  These findings suggest that expectations 
and desire for improvement continue to remain ahead of  the implementation of  
improvements themselves.

4.4 Future expectations for infrastructure and services
Respondents were also asked about their expectations for basic infrastructure and 
services in the coming year. The majority of  respondents expect to see improvements 
in their local area in all the amenities and services mentioned. More than four fifths 
of  respondents expect to see improvements in the availability of  clean drinking wa-
ter (85%) and the availability of  education for children (81%). About three quarters 
expect improvement in the availability of  water for irrigation (78%), the availability 
of  clinics and hospitals (75%) and medicines (74%). Respondents are less optimistic 
about the prospects for improvements in electricity supply (67%) and the availability 
of  jobs (64%), although a clear majority still think that these will get better.

Optimism about future improvements in basic infrastructure and services has not 
changed substantially since 2007 despite some minor fluctuations. However, in 2009 
there is an increase in the proportion of  respondents who are optimistic about im-
provements in the electricity supply (67%) as compared to 62 percent in 2008 and 61 
percent in 2007. This may be correlated with the higher proportion of  respondents 
in 2009 who say that the electricity supply in their local area is good, even though 
they are still the minority (see Table 4.3).

4.5 Important development issues
The survey also examined how people prioritize development needs, particularly in 
terms of  basic infrastructure such as electricity supply, water, roads, health care and 
education. Respondents were asked to rank these issues in order of  priority; from 
1 - most important to 5 - least important.
Survey results show that at the national level, roads and power are ranked equally as 
the top priorities followed by water supply, health care and education, although the 
difference in priority accorded to these five issues is not substantial. There has, how-
ever, been a shift in the public’s priority since last year. In 2008 power was identified 
as the top priority whereas in 2009 electricity supply is in second place and the top 
priority is again roads, as it was in 2007.

The priorities for development differ between regions. Roads emerge as the top pri-
ority for inhabitants of  the Central/Kabul, South West, North East and North West 
regions, while those living in the South East rank power supply as the top priority. 
Economy and Development 51
The top priority in the West is water supply and in the East it is health care. Respon-
dents in the Central/Hazarajat give equal weight to power supply and water supply.

4.6 Electricity supply
Electricity is regularly identified as a priory issue for communities. For this reason 
the survey sought to obtain a more detailed picture of  access to electricity across 
Afghanistan. When asked about their electricity supply at home, one third (33%) of  
respondents report that they have no access to any kind of  electricity whatsoever. 
However, the proportion with no access to electricity is lower in 2009 than that 
recorded in previous years (43% in 2008, 41% in 2007 and 42% in 2006). This sug-
gests that there have been some improvements in the supply of  electricity to Afghan 
homes. The highest proportions of  respondents with no access to electricity are in 
the North East (50%), South West (44%) and West (40%) regions. 
One fifth of  respondents (20%) have access to government electricity with a direct 
line dedicated to the house and 3 percent have access to government supplied elec-
tricity by other means. However, while around nine in ten houses in rural areas have 
no access to state-supplied electricity, two thirds (67%) of  urban households have 
access to electricity provided by the government.  
The remainder rely mostly on generators which are either community owned (16%), 
privately owned (12%) or owned by neighbors (11%). Across the country, 4 percent 
of  respondents say they have access to electricity generated by solar panels. These 
are mostly mentioned by rural (5%) rather than urban (1%) respondents, and are 
particularly prevalent in Central Hazarajat (12%), South East (10%), South West 
(8%) and East (5%).

The survey then sought to examine the cost effectiveness of  the electricity supply to 
afghan homes. The table below summarizes the various types of  electricity people 
use at home, their daily hours of  electricity consumption and their monthly spending 
on electricity. 
Table 4.9: Kinds of  electricity supply used at home (%), average consumption of  electricity (hours)

g) Solar panels for producing electricity 4 4.8 194
Economy and Development 53
The table indicates that those receiving government supplied electricity use the most 
electric power on a daily basis. On average they have access to electricity for between 
14 and 19 hours a day. Average monthly spending on government supplied electricity 
ranges from 640 Afs for those accessing government supply through other sources 
to 903 Afs for those with a direct supply to their house. However, given the extended 
periods of  supply this is amongst the cheapest forms of  electricity available, averag-
ing about 1.5Afs per hour of  electricity supplied. Government supplied electricity is 
more than six times cheaper than electricity from a private generator whose average 
cost is around 10Afs per hour of  supply. The only source of  electricity that is cheap-
er than public supply is solar power. The small proportion of  respondents using 
this form of  electricity generation (4%) on average pay 194 Afs a month for up to 
5 hours daily supply. This works out at around 1.3 Afs per hour of  electricity. These 
figures suggest that solar power might be a cost effective solution to rural energy 
provision, particularly if  the quantity of  electricity supplied can be increased  
4.7 Main source of energy for lighting, cooking and heating 
Electricity is the most commonly used source of  energy for lighting (46%), particu-
larly in urban areas. Four fifths (80%) of  urban respondents say they use electricity as 
the main source of  energy for lighting, compared to just over a third (37%) of  rural 
respondents. The other major sources of  energy for lighting are kerosene (26%) and 
bottled gas/LPG (15%).   
However, more than half  of  the respondents (52%) use firewood as their main 
source of  energy for cooking. Other main sources of  energy for this purpose include 
bottled gas/LPG (23%) and animal dung/manure (16%). Use of  firewood for cook-
ing is significantly higher in rural (59%) than urban (26%) areas, while the use of  
bottled gas/LPG is significantly higher in urban (66%) than rural (11%) settings.  
Firewood is the main source of  energy for heating (39%) in both rural and urban 
areas. There is also significant use of  electricity (28%), particularly in the urban areas, 
and use of  animal dung/manure (17%) and charcoal (14%).  
Overall firewood is the most widely used source of  energy in Afghan households 
(70%) and is used for both cooking and heating.  Electricity is the next most widely 
used, although mostly for lighting. Electricity is the main source of  energy in urban 
areas (81%). Bottled gas/LPG (38%) is the next most widely used source of  energy 
and is used for all purposes, although only a small minority use this for heating.

4.8 Development Programs and Public Awareness of Foreign Aid
The international community and donor agencies are supporting a wide variety of  
projects and programs in Afghanistan. The survey sought to gauge respondents’ 
knowledge about the implementation of  development programs in their local area. 
All respondents were asked whether they knew of, or had heard of, any project or 
program implemented with foreign aid in their area or district in the last 12 months. 
Respondents were then given a list of  the kinds of  development programs that 
might be present in their area.
More than half  (54%) of  respondents say that they are aware of  projects relating 
to education (reconstruction/opening of  schools, training teachers etc.), which is 
consistent with the general perception that access to education is the service that 
has shown the greatest improvement over the past three years (see 4.2 - Development 
for Afghan Households).
A similar proportion say that they are aware of  reconstruction projects involving the 
building of  roads and bridges (52%). Projects related to water supply for drinking are 
mentioned by 42 percent of  respondents and healthcare programs, such as primary 
health centers and regular visits of  doctors, are mentioned by 40 percent.
Responses in this regard in 2009 are broadly similar to those recorded in previous 
years. Awareness of  education and reconstruction programs has topped the list for 
four consecutive years. This suggests that the majority of  development programs 
mostly respond to the development issues that are generally prioritized by the people 
Economy and Development 55
(see 4.4 – Important development issues). However, just over a quarter (28%) of  respon-
dents report being aware of  development programs targeting the electricity supply 
which remains one of  the most pressing issues for Afghans.

In order to measure public perceptions of  who is primarily responsible for provid-
ing aid for development projects, respondents were asked whether they thought the 
Afghan Government, foreign sponsors or both were responsible for these activities 
in various sectors. The findings reveal that the Afghan Government is seen to be 
the primary agency responsible for the supply of  electricity (55%), supply of  water 
for irrigation (55%) and the in the development of  education by reconstruction of  
schools or opening of  new ones (54%). The government is seen to contribute a lot 
into building new mosques (70%). The Afghan Government is also seen to be lead-
ing in the field of  reconstruction programs in agriculture (49%), demilitarization and 
disarmament (47%), reconstruction programs in industry (47%), provision of  water 
for drinking (46%) and healthcare (45%). Almost equal credit is given to the govern-
ment and to foreign donors for programs dealing with the reconstruction or building 
of  roads and bridges or in humanitarian programs. Foreign donors are seen to have 
a leading role in de-mining programs.

Respondents who identified foreign sponsors, alone or alongside the Afghan Gov-
ernment, as the primary agencies responsible for implementing projects in their area or 
district (70% of  all respondents) were also asked which countries they think have pro-
vided this assistance. The country mentioned most often is the USA (41%) followed by 
Germany (8%) and Japan (7%). This finding largely matches those of  2006, 2007 and 
2008. However, the figures in 2009 are slightly lower than in previous years.

The United States is identified as the major donor in all regions (41%), followed by 
Germany (8%), Japan (7%) and India (5%). Many respondents also mention the 
local Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) (3%) or foreign countries (3%) as the 
major donor without identifying any specific country providing the assistance.
Respondents were then asked to mention any other countries which they think have 
provided aid for the projects in their area or district. Overall, the countries seen to 
provide the most aid to Afghanistan (either as the major donor or alongside other 
donors) are still the USA (31%), followed by Germany (13%), Japan (12%) and 
India (10%) which are seen to be active in all regions. However, a number of  other 
donors are mentioned by a significant proportion of  respondents in regions where 
they are particularly active. For example, in the East respondents mention China 
(10%), Pakistan (7%), Sweden (6%) and Saudi Arabia (5%). In the South East they 
identify Poland (5%) as well as the PRT (7%). In the South West respondents men-
tion Canada (9%), the UK (5%) and Saudi Arabia (5%) as well as local PRT (7%). In 
the West, Iran (8%), Italy (8%) and France (5%) are identified as significant donors. 
France is also mentioned in the North East (10%). In the Central/Kabul region, 
France (7%), Turkey (7%) and China (5%) are identified most often. However, in the 
Central/Hazarajat region comparatively few respondents identify donor countries 
other than the major four.

Government 59
5 Government
The survey attempted to examine Afghans’ experience of  interacting with a range of  
governance institutions at the national and local levels. These include local administra-
tive authorities such as Provincial and District Governors and Municipalities and elect-
ed representatives at national and local levels including Members of  Parliament (MPs), 
Provincial Council and Community Development Council representatives. Respon-
dents were asked about the performance of  these institutions and their responsiveness 
to people’s needs including whether or not they have been successful in addressing 
local problems.  In addition, the survey collected people’s views on the representation 
of  different social groups at the community level and on the role of  particular groups 
in political decision-making processes including consultation with religious leaders.
5.1 Performance of National Government
When asked to assess how well the national government is carrying out its respon-
sibilities, almost three quarters of  respondents (71%) give a positive assessment, 
including one in five (19 %) who say that the government is doing a very good job. 
In 2008, only two thirds of  respondents (67%) gave a positive assessment, which 
indicates that 2009 has seen a small increase in satisfaction with the national govern-
ment. However, the assessment of  government performance is still less positive than 
in 2007 when four out of  five respondents (80%) said the government was doing a 
good job, including one in four (25%) who said it was doing a very good job. 
Thinking of  the National Government, how do you feel about the way it is carrying out its responsi-
bilities? (Q-59) COMPARISON BETWEEN 2007, 2008 AND 2009

Women have a more positive view of  national government performance than men. 
Three quarters of  women (75%) say the government is doing a good job compared 
to around two thirds of  men (66%). Public perception of  the government’s perfor-
mance is most favorable in the East (86%), North West (82%) and North East (75%) 
regions, but least favorable in the South West (59%), Central/Hazarajat (61%) and 
South East (63%). However, even in these regions the majority of  respondents still 
judge government performance favorably. 
The survey then sought a more in-depth understanding of  these responses by in-
vestigating respondents’ views on the government’s performance in specific areas 
such as education, healthcare, creating job opportunities, maintaining relations with 
neighboring countries, reviving/developing the economy, fighting corruption and 
providing security.
The government’s performance is judged most positively with regard to the provision 
of  education, healthcare and security which are the basic public services. More than 
four-fifths of  respondents (83%) say the government is doing  either a somewhat good 
job or a very good job providing education. Just under two-thirds (63%) say the same 
about the provision of  healthcare and a similar proportion (61%) have the same view 
with respect to the provision of  security. The majority of  respondents also give a posi-
tive assessment of  government performance in maintaining relations with neighboring 
countries (58%). On the other hand, a significant majority of  respondents say that the 
government is doing a bad job in creating jobs (71%), fighting corruption (68%) and 
reviving/developing the economy (62%). These findings are consistent with respon-
dents’ views of  the situation in their local area where the majority are most satisfied 
with the availability of  education for children, but least satisfied with the availability of  
jobs (see Chapter 4, 4.3 Availability of  basic amenities). This correlation clearly indicates that 
the public’s assessment of  government performance is closely related to the ability of  
the national government to provide the basic services and amenities that people need.

People living in urban areas give a more positive assessment of  the performance of  
the national government in all domains. The largest differences of  opinion concern 
the provision of  security (71% of  urban respondents say the government is doing 
a good job in this regard, compared to 58% of  respondents in rural areas) and the 
provision of  healthcare (73% of  urban respondents give a positive assessment of  
government performance as compared to 61% in rural areas). 
Across the country the most positive assessments of  government performance in 
all domains is recorded in the North West and Eastern regions. Whereas, the low-
est levels of  satisfaction are consistently recorded in the Central/Hazarajat, South 
West and West. The lowest level of  satisfaction regarding the provision of  security 
is recorded in the South East.

However, in understanding the factors that influence respondents’ assessments of  
the government performance, it is interesting to consider the level of  actual contact 
people have with government institutions and services. A separate set of  questions 
reveal that a substantial proportion of  respondents have had no contact with gov-
ernment agencies in the last year. This ranges from a third (33%) who have had no 
contact with public health services to 38 percent who have had no contact with the 
Afghan National Police (ANP), to 44 percent who have had no contact with state 
electricity services or with the courts to around half  who have had no contact with 
the Afghan National Army (ANA) (47%). Moreover, levels of  contact vary widely 
between regions. Notably, in the Central/Hazarajat region, the majority of  respon-
Afghanistan in 200962
dents have had no contact with any of  these government services in the past year. 
These figures indicate that the presence and accessibility of  government institu-
tions is likely to be a factor that influences respondents’ perceptions of  govern-
ment performance.

The survey also asked respondents to identify what they thought was the most im-
portant achievement of  the current government in the past few years. Respondents 
were asked to mention up to two important achievements. The most commonly 
mentioned achievement of  the current government is reconstruction (32%) fol-
lowed by establishing peace and security (27%) and a better education system (26%). 
These findings are largely coherent with the reasons for optimism mentioned by 
respondents who say that the country is moving in the right direction (see Chapter 2, 
2.2: Reasons for optimism).

Reconstruction is most often mentioned as the most important acheivement of  the 
current government in the Central/Kabul (39%), North East (37%), West (33%) and 
North West (31%) regions, but least often mentioned in the Central/Hazarajat (18%). 
Similarly, establishing peace and security is mentioned by a little less than half  of  
respondents in the North West (46%) and North East (42%), but only one in ten 
in the South West (10%) and South East (11%). Again this suggests that there are 
wide disparities across the country in the impact and perceptions of  government 
performance in these domains. On the other hand, the proportion of  respondents 
who identify a better education system or freedom of  speech as the most important 
government achievements shows little variation between regions. 
In the same vein, the survey asked respondents about the most important failing of  
the current government. The most commonly mentioned government failings are 
insecurity (31%), administrative corruption (29%), lack of  job opportunities (20%), 
weak economy (15%) and weak government (13%). Eight percent of  the respondents 
are unable or unwilling to identify any failures of  the current government. These are 
the same issues highlighted by those respondents who say that the country is moving 
in the wrong direction (see Chapter 2, 2.3: Reasons of  pessimism).

Insecurity is most often mentioned in the South West (41%), South East (39%), and 
West (33%), which are the areas in which the majority of  respondents rate the secu-
rity in their local area as poor or very poor (see 3, 3.1 Security Situation). This is also the 
case in the Central/Kabul region (34%) where insecurity is the top issue mentioned. 
Respondents in these same areas most often mention weak government as a major fail-
Afghanistan in 200964
ing, suggesting again that the government’s capacity to ensure security is amongst the 
most important factors that influence perceptions of  government performance. Weak 
government is also mentioned often in the Central/Hazarajat region where satisfaction 
with government performance is lowest across all domains (see Table 5.2). The lack of  
job opportunities and the weak economy are most often mentioned in the North West, 
North East and Central/Kabul regions. Other major government failings which have 
particular resonance in certain regions include removing the Taliban mentioned by one 
in six respondents in the West (15%) and one in ten in the East (11%) and South West 
(10%), removing drugs mentioned by one in ten respondents in the West (10%) and 
preventing civilian casualties mentioned by one in seven respondents in the East (14%) 
and around one in ten in the South West (9%) and South East (8%).
Given the importance of  security issues in perceptions of  government performance, 
the survey sought to examine public opinion on certain aspects of  the government’s 
approach to security. In particular, the survey asked respondents whether they ap-
prove or disapprove of  the current government’s efforts at negotiation and recon-
ciliation with armed anti-government elements. Nearly three-quarters of  respon-
dents (71%) say they approve of  these efforts, although 43 percent express some 
reservations. A quarter of  respondents (25%) say they disapprove of  this approach, 
although only one in ten (10%) strongly disapproves. These findings indicate that 
Afghans support the government’s efforts to address state security issues through 
talks with opposition groups, rather than by military means exclusively. 
Do you strongly approve, approve somewhat, disapprove somewhat or strongly disapprove of  the 
Afghan Government’s reconciliation efforts and negotiations with armed Anti-Government ele-
ments? (Q-64a, Base 6406)

Support for efforts to negotiate and achieve reconciliation with armed opposition 
groups varies little between regions, with the exception of  the Central/Hazarajat 
where just over half  (52%) of  respondents say they approve of  this approach and 
one in three (33%) say they disapprove.
The survey also asked respondents about their level of  sympathy for the reasons why 
anti-government groups have used violence during the past year. Responses show 
that a slight majority (56%) say that they have some level of  sympathy with the mo-
tivations of  armed opposition groups, including around one in five (22%) who say 
they have a lot of  sympathy. These results certainly help to explain the high levels of  
support for a conciliatory approach to addressing anti-government violence.
Thinking about the reasons anti-government groups used violence during the past year, would you 
say that you in general have a lot of  sympathy, a little sympathy, or no sympathy at all for the 
reasons these anti-government groups choose to use violence? (Q-64b, Base 6406)

Levels of  sympathy with anti-government violence are higher in rural areas (57%) 
than in urban settings (48%). There is relatively little variation between ethnic groups 
in their sympathy for the motivations of  armed opposition groups. The majority of  
all groups record some level of  sympathy with the highest levels recorded by Uzbeks 
(60%) and Pashtuns (59%) and the lowest by Tajiks (51%). Responses vary more 
significantly between regions. The highest levels of  sympathy are recorded in the 
South East (66%) and East (65%) where two thirds of  respondents say they have 
some sympathy with the reasons that armed opposition groups use violence, how-
ever this is the case for fewer than half  of  respondents in the Central/Kabul (46%) 
and Central/Hazarajat (48%) regions.

5.2 Performance of provincial government
Respondents were also asked to assess the performance of  the provincial govern-
ment in their area. Three-quarters of  respondents (75%) give a positive assessment 
and nearly a quarter (24%) say that the provincial government is doing a very good 
job. These findings are entirely consistent with the findings of  previous years. 
However, assessment of  the performance of  provincial government varies between 
regions. Although the overall assessment of  the performance of  provincial govern-
ment is positive in all regions, the highest levels of  satisfaction are recorded in the 
East (85%) and North West (81%) where more than four out of  five respondents say 
that the provincial government is doing a good job. These high levels of  satisfaction 
are recorded in eight individual provinces: Balkh (94%), Laghman (90%), Baghlan 
(88%), Badakhshan (88%), Badghis (89%), Panjshir (87%), Nangarhar (87%) and 
Sar-i-pul (83%)
The highest level of  dissatisfaction is recorded in the South West where around 
one in three respondents (36%) say the provincial government is doing a bad job. 
Around two-thirds of  respondents in Zabul (67%) and Uruzgan (63%) say that their 
provincial Government is doing a bad job, nearly twice the figure recorded in other 
provinces.
Turning to your Provincial Government, do you think that overall it is doing a very good job, some-

5.3 Performance of municipal and local authorities
The survey also asked about the performance of  municipal and local authorities. 
People living in urban areas (21% of  all respondents) were asked questions pertain-
ing to municipal authorities.
Again the majority of  respondents living in urban areas (58%) think that the municipal 
authority in their local area is doing a good job, including 17 percent who say it is doing 
a very good job. However, the level of  satisfaction with municipal government perfor-
mance is significantly lower than the proportion of  respondents who say the central 
government (71%) and provincial government (75%) are doing a good job. Forty per-
cent of  respondents give a negative assessment of  the performance of  the municipal-
ity in their locality, including around one in six (15%) who say it is doing a very bad 
job. Yet despite these relatively low levels of  satisfaction compared to other levels of  
government, in 2009, levels of  satisfaction with the performance of  municipal au-
thorities increased compared to 2008, and the proportion of  respondents who say that 
municipal authorities are doing a very good job is higher than in previous years.  
The most positive assessment of  the performance of  municipal authorities is in the 
North West where almost nine in ten respondents (88%) say their local municipality 
is doing a good job. However, significant majorities say the same in the East (71%), 
South East (71%) and North East (62%). On the other hand, the highest level of  
dissatisfaction is recorded in the Central/Kabul region where nearly half  of  respon-
dents (49%) say that their local municipal authorities are doing a bad job. 
What do you think about the job done by your municipal authorities? Do you think that overall 
it is doing a very good job, somewhat good job, somewhat bad job or a very bad job? (Q-65b, Base

The survey asked a similar question about the performance of  local authorities at 
the district level to people living in rural areas (79% of  all respondents). Overall, 
more than two-thirds of  respondents (69%) rate the performance of  their district 
authorities positively, considerably more than those who give a positive assessment 
of  the performance of  municipal authorities in urban areas (58%). Around a quarter 
of  rural respondents (23%) say their local district authorities are doing a very good 
job. However, 28 percent think the district authorities in their localities are doing a 
bad job. These findings show almost no variation from 2008. 
The largest proportions of  respondents who say that their local district authority is 
doing a good job are in the North West (81%), East (77%) and North East (76%) 
followed by the West (67%). However the highest levels of  dissatisfaction are re-
corded in the South West, where nearly half  (48%) of  respondents say that their 
district authorities are doing a bad job. Over one in three respondents say the same 
in the South East (38%) and Central/Hazarajat (37%) regions.

The overall picture of  public perceptions of  the performance of  different levels 
of  government shows that respondents are most positive about the performance 
of  their provincial government, followed by the national government and rural 
district authorities. They are least satisfied with the performance of  municipalities. 
However, since 2007 satisfaction with provincial and national level authorities has 
fallen, whereas satisfaction with municipal authorities is now about the same as it 
was two years ago.

5.4 Corruption
One of  the major problems facing Afghanistan identified by respondents is the is-
sue of  corruption including administrative corruption. (See 2, 2.4 Afghanistan’s biggest 
problems: National level). The level of  corruption in public institutions is an important 
measure of  government performance, both in terms of  equity and efficiency. The 
survey therefore sought to measure public perceptions of  the prevalence of  cor-
ruption at different levels of  government and in various facets of  life. Respondents 
were asked whether they think corruption is a major problem, a minor problem or 
no problem at all in their daily life, their neighborhood, their local authorities, their 
provincial government and in Afghanistan as a whole.
Results show that the majority of  Afghans think that corruption is a major problem 
in all facets of  life and at all levels of  government. Moreover, as in previous years, 
perceptions of  the prevalence of  corruption rise as the level of  the institution rises. 
While just over half  of  respondents (53%) say that corruption is a major prob-
lem in their local authorities,  just under two thirds (61%) say the same about their 
provincial governments, and around three quarters (76%) say this with regard to 
Afghanistan as a whole. Conversely, while only one in twenty respondents say that 
corruption is not a problem for the country as a whole (5%), three times as many say 
that it is not a problem in their daily life (15%).

This pattern is consistent with previous years. However, while the perception of  cor-
ruption in Afghanistan as a whole has remained stable, the proportion of  respondents 
who identify this as a major problem in their daily life and in their neighbourhood has 
been rising steadily since 2006. Encouragingly, the proportion that identify corruption 
as a major problem in their provincial government has fallen (from 66% in 2006 to 
61% in 2009). However, the reverse is true for local authorities. Under half  (48%) of  
respondents said that corruption was a major problem at this level of  government in 
2007, but more than half  had this opinion in 2008 (53%) and 2009 (53%).

To further explore trends in public perceptions of  corruption, respondents were 
also asked to compare the level of  corruption now with one year ago. Over half  
(54%) of  respondents think that the amount of  corruption has increased in Afghan-
istan as whole, while 41 percent think that it has done so at provincial government 
level. A third (32%) of  respondents think that corruption has increased in their local 
authorities and around a quarter believe this is true in their neighborhood (24%) and 
in their daily lives (23%). The findings suggest that respondents are more likely to 
identify an increase in corruption in domains where they perceive corruption to be 
generally high. However, since 2006 there has been a consistent fall in the proportion 
of  respondents who say there been an annual increase in corruption in Afghanistan 
as a whole (from 60% in 2006 to 54% in 2009) and in their provincial government 
(from 50% in 2006 to 41% in 2009).

The survey also attempted to measure respondents’ personal experience of  corrup-
tion in various facets of  public life by asking how often in the past year they had to 
give cash, a gift or perform a favor for a government official. Responses show that 
the majority of  contacts with government institutions do not involve corruption. 
This suggests that people’s overall perception of  the prevalence of  corruption is 
higher than their personal experience of  it. The situations in which respondents 
have most frequently encountered corruption (either in all cases when they had con-
tact or in most cases) are in receiving official documents (30%), applying for jobs 
(27%), and dealing with the judiciary/courts (26%). However, around one in five 
respondents report encountering corruption in receiving public healthcare services 
(21%), dealing with officials in the municipality (21%), getting admissions to schools 
or universities (20%), dealing with the ANP (19%) and dealing with state electricity 
supply (19%) or the customs office (19%). The lowest incidence of  corruption is 
recorded in dealings with the ANA, although corrupt practices are still reported by 
one in ten respondents (11%).

Respondents’ experience of  corruption in various institutions is broadly correlated 
with the low levels of  public confidence expressed in these same institutions. Insti-
tutions in which respondents frequently report corrupt practices also register par-
ticularly low levels of  public confidence including municipalities (46% confidence), 
the government justice system (46%), government ministries (53% confidence) and 
the public administration as a whole (57% confidence) (see Chapter 2, 2.6: Confidence in 
specific institutions and organizations).
5.5 Contact with local government to solve local problems
Respondents were asked whether, at any time in the past five years, they had asked 
for the help of  a government official or a government agency to resolve an issue 
that concerned everybody in their area but which they could not resolve on their 
own. The majority of  respondents (71%) say that they have not had such a problem. 
However, just under a quarter (23%) report that they have sought assistance from a 
government agency to resolve a problem of  this kind.
Among those who have sought assistance (23% of  all respondents), most people 
have done this to resolve problems related to a lack of  water and electricity (21%) 
or disputes over land (17%). Respondents have also sought help from government 
agencies in relation to other problems with basic infrastructure such as reconstruc-
tion of  roads and bridges (10%). Security issues have prompted requests for assis-
tance from 10 percent while a small proportion has asked for help to resolve tribal 
disputes (6%).
Government 73
Sometimes people and communities have problems, related to an issue that concerns everybody in 
their area, that they can’t resolve on their own and so they have to ask for the help of  a government 
official or a government agency. In the past 5 years, has your community had such a problem in your 
area that you had to ask for help or cooperation to resolve it? ( YES responses) - What kind of

When asked who they approached to solve the problem, one-third of  respondents 
(34%) mention elders of  local shura or jirga, demonstrating the continuing impor-
tance of  informal community governance structures in resolving problems at the 
community level. A significant proportion report taking their problem to the local 
administration, with a higher proportion seeking help from district authorities (20%) 
than from authorities at the provincial level (17%). Twelve percent have sought the 
help of  the Afghan National Police which has a clear responsibility for law enforce-
ment at the local level. Ten percent say they approached a semi-formal malik or 
khan at the village level to help solve their problem. A similar proportion say they 
asked for assistance from government agencies (9%) or from elected representatives 
including community development councils (9%) and MPs (7%).

has been resolved while a slightly smaller proportion (44%) say the problem is still 
pending resolution.
A high proportion of  those who approached the state security services have had 
their problem resolved. This is the case for over half  of  those who took their prob-
lem to the ANA (58%) and ANP (57%). The majority of  people who approached 
traditional institutions at the community level such as mullah (55%), malik/khan 
(50%) and shura/jirga (49%) had their problems solved. The efficacy of  these insti-
tutions in resolving local issues may help explain why levels of  public confidence in 
them is relatively high (see Chapter 2, 2.6 - Confidence in specific institutions and organiza-
tions). Bodies close to the local level also resolved just under half  of  the problems 
presented to them, including District Authorities (48%) and Community Develop-
ment Councils (43%) 
By contrast, only around a third (35%) of  respondents, who approached govern-
ment authorities at the provincial level and a quarter (24%) who sought help from 
national government offices, have had their problems resolved. This may also offer a 
partial explanation for the relatively low levels of  public confidence recorded in the 
public administration (see Chapter 2, 2.6 - Confidence in institutions and organizations).

5.6 Role of elected representative bodies
The survey sought to examine people’s perceptions of  elected representative bodies 
including parliament and members of  parliament (MPs) at the national level, Pro-
vincial Councils (PC) at the provincial level and Community Development Councils 
(CDC) that operate at villages and community level in rural areas.
To assess perceptions of  the responsiveness of  national level representatives to 
meeting the needs of  the people, respondents were asked whether they agree or 
disagree with the statement: “The Parliament is addressing the major problems of  
people in our country.” Overall, more than two-thirds of  respondents (68%) agree 
with this statement including around a quarter (24%) who strongly agree. However, 
just under a third of  respondents (30%) disagree, including one in ten (10%) who 
disagree strongly. These findings are broadly similar to those recorded in 2008.
Levels of  agreement are particularly high in the North West (77%), Central/Hazara-
jat (73%), Central/Kabul (70%) and East (70%), while disagreement is highest in the 
South East (38%), West (36%) and South West (34%) regions.

The majority of  respondents (58%) also agree with the statement: “My MP is ad-
dressing the major problems of  my constituency in the Parliament”, including one 
in five (20%) who strongly agree. However, more than a third of  respondents (39%) 
disagree with this statement.
Afghanistan in 200976
The highest levels of  agreement are in the North West (72%), Central/Hazarajat 
(64%) and East (61%), which are also the regions that report the highest levels of  
satisfaction with the responsiveness of  Parliament to the needs of  the country as a 
whole. On the other hand, nearly half  of  respondents disagree with this statement 
in the South East (49%) and South West (49%).

Overall, levels of  satisfaction with the performance of  MPs in addressing the major 
problems of  their constituencies in the Parliament has fallen steadily since 2006, sug-
gesting increasing disenchantment with the ability of  MPs to address local problems 
through the parliamentary channel. However, results in 2009 show a small improve-
ment compared to 2008.

5.7 Contacts with Members of Parliament (MPs)
The survey also sought to examine in greater detail people’s perceptions of  the re-
sponsiveness of  MPs in addressing problems in their constituencies by looking at 
their involvement in resolving local problems experienced by individuals and com-
munities. Respondents were asked: “Have you ever contacted your MP for help in 
solving any of  your personal or local problems?” Only around one in eight respon-
dents (12%) report ever having contacted their MP for help of  this kind. Men (16%) 
are twice as likely as women (8%) to have done so. Respondents living in villages 
(14%) are also twice as likely to have done so as those living in urban areas (7%). 
Contact with MPs for this purpose is most frequently reported by respondents in the 
South East (19%) and East (17%) of  the country. 
Those respondents who had contacted their MP for help in solving local problems 
(12% of  all respondents) were then asked what kind of  problem was involved. 
Problems relating to basic infrastructure and services are the most common reasons 
why respondents have contacted their MPs, including lack of  water and electricity 
(19%), lack of  roads and bridges (12%), lack of  security (8%) and lack of  teachers 
in schools (8%). One in ten respondents (10%) mention land disputes and one in 
fifteen (6%) mention tribal problems. More urban (26%) than rural residents (18%) 
have contacted their MP about water and electricity problems, whereas problems 
related to land dispute are more frequently raised by rural residents (11%) than those 
living in urban areas (1%).

Respondents were then asked whether their MPs tried to help to resolve the prob-
lem. A small majority (53%) say the MP tried to help, while 43 percent say they did 
not.  This finding seems consistent with the proportion of  respondents who agree 
that their MP is addressing the major problems of  their constituency in the parlia-
ment (58%) (see 5.6 - Role of  elected representatives). 
Finally, respondents were asked whether the problem had been resolved, regardless 
of  who helped. Slightly more than half  (53%) say that the problem has not been 
solved, whereas 43 percent report that it has. 
5.8 Contacts with Provincial Council representatives
Respondents were asked the same question about contacting a representative of  the 
Provincial Council (PC) for help in solving any personal or local problems. Again, 
an overwhelming majority (82%) has not done this, however almost one in six (15%) 
say they have contacted a PC representative for assistance. This figure has remained 
broadly the same since 2006.
Respondents who had contacted a PC representative for help (15% of  all respon-
dents) were further asked for what kind of  problem they had sought help. The re-
sults show that people contact PC members about the same kinds of  issues that they 
take to MPs. These include problems related to basic infrastructure and services such 
as electricity and water (23%), roads and bridges (11%), building schools (6%), and 
building clinics (5%). Likewise, disputes over land (10%) and tribal problems (7%) 
are also a commmon reason for contacting PC representatives.

Problems related to electricity and water account for the greatest number of  requests 
for help from PC representatives in almost every region, although they are almost as 
common as issues relating to roads and bridges in the Central/Kabul region (22%) 
and land disputes in the East (17%) and South West (21%). The exception is the 
Central/Hazarajat region where problems related to teachers and schools are the 
main reasons why respondents had contacted their Provincial Council representa-
tive. Respondents in the South West, West and South East are twice as likely to have 
contacted their PC representative about tribal problems as those in other regions, 
whereas respondents in the Central/Kabul and Central/Hazarajat regions are twice 
as likely to have approached a PC member about economic problems in contrast to 
other parts of  the country.

Respondents were further asked whether, when asked for assistance, the PC repre-
sentative tried to help resolve the problem. Nearly two-thirds of  respondents (62%) 
say their PC representative tried to help which is a significantly higher proportion 
than those who said the same about their MP (53%). The remaining third (35%) said 
the PC representative did not try to assist. 
Finally, respondents were again asked whether the problem was resolved, regard-
less of  who helped. Just under half  (47%) of  respondents report that the problem 
was solved, whereas a similar proportion (49%) say it was not. The proportion of  
problems taken to PC members which have been resolved is slightly higher than for 
those taken to MPs (43%).
5.9 Role of Community Development Councils
Community Development Councils (CDCs) have been established as part of  the 
National Solidarity Program as elected community development governance bodies 
in rural areas. CDCs currently cover 23,180 rural communities, accounting for 72 
percent of  villages4 across Afghanistan, with plans to achieve full national coverage 
over time. The role of  CDCs is defined in a specific bylaw to provide the “social and 
development foundation at community level, responsible for implementation and 
supervision of  development projects and liaison between the communities and gov-
4  Source: Information provided by National Solidarity Program (NSP), Afghanistan (September 2009)
Government 81
ernment and non-government organizations.” Current government policy indicates 
that CDCs are likely to play the role of  Village Councils provided for in the Afghan 
Constitution until appropriate legislation is passed and elections are held to formally 
constitute such bodies.  
The survey attempted to measure public awareness and views about CDCs. Respon-
dents received a brief  explanation about CDCs and were then asked whether they 
are aware of  such institutions in their neighborhood. Forty-four percent of  the re-
spondents say they are aware of  a CDC in their area, while just over half  (51%) say 
they are not. As CDCs operate essentially in rural areas, awareness is more than twice 
as high amongst rural respondents (49%) as amongst urban dwellers (23%). More-
over, across the country as a whole, awareness of  CDCs has been steadily rising in 
recent years. Although only around a third of  respondents said they were aware of  
CDCs in 2006 (37%) and 2007 (32%), the figure is close to half  (44%) in 2009. 
Are you aware of  an institution called a Community Development Council formed in your neighbor-
hood/settlement? (Q-91) COMPARISON BETWEEN 2006, 2007, 2008 AND 2009 
Fig 5.18
The level of  public awareness of  CDCs varies between regions, which is to be ex-
pected as the program has not yet covered the entire country. The majority of  re-
spondents say they are aware of  a CDC in their local area in the East (57%) and 
North West (50%), however, this is true for only around a third of  respondents in 
the South West (36%) and Central/Hazarajat (33%) regions.

Respondents who are aware of  a CDC in their neighborhood (44% of  all respon-
dents) were also asked to indicate which social groups are members of  the CDC. A 
list of  groups was read out and respondents were asked to say whether these groups 
are represented on the CDC in their area. Traditional local leaders are most often 
mentioned as members of  CDCs. Around three-quarters of  respondents say that 
elders of  the local shura/jirga (77%) or a local Malik/Khan (71%) are members. 
Around half  also mention other influential members of  the community such as 
mullahs (56%) and local teachers (48%). A third say local commanders (32%) are 
members. However, a significant proportion of  respondents also indicate that their 
local CDC includes representation of  less powerful social groups such as ordinary 
farmers (45%), shopkeepers (40%) and landless agricultural workers (36%). Around 
a quarter (27%) of  respondents say that women are represented on their local CDC. 
Just under a quarter (23%) mention public officials from the municipality or district 
administration amongst the members of  their local CDC. These findings are broadly 
similar to those in 2007 and 2008.

These same respondents were also asked about their level of  satisfaction with the job 
their local CDC is doing. Overall, more than three quarters of  respondents (78%) say 
they are satisfied with the performance of  their local CDC, including a third (32%) 
who are very satisfied. Only around one in five (19%) respondents express some level 
of  dissatisfaction. This finding is also largely similar to those of  2007 and 2008.

About four-fifths (81%) say that their CDC is capable to represent their interests 
before the provincial authorities, while just under two thirds (62%) say it is capable to 
do so before the national government. Confidence in the representative capabilities 
of  CDCs in relation to provincial authorities has not changed since 2008, however, 
a much smaller proportion judge their CDC capable of  representing their interests 
at the national level in 2009 (62%) than in 2008 (82%) when respondents judged the 
CDC equally capable to represent them at the provincial and national levels. This 
may indicate that in 2009, which is an election year at the provincial level, respon-
dents are making a clearer distinction between the different levels of  government 
and their functions than they have done in the past.

Justice System 85
6 Justice System
6.1 The formal and informal justice system in Afghanistan
In the last few years the Afghan Government, with the help of  the international 
community, has sought to strengthen the formal judicial system and establish the 
rule of  law. However, a significant proportion of  the Afghan population continues 
to rely on informal tribal or traditional systems of  justice to address issues of  crime 
or resolve disputes. In 2009, the survey again attempted to examine public percep-
tions of  both formal and informal justice mechanisms and the recourse people have 
to them for reporting and redressing crime and for dispute resolution.
6.2 Perceptions of state courts
To examine public perceptions of  state courts a series of  statements related to the 
qualities and performance of  these institutions was read out and respondents were 
asked to say whether they agree or disagree. Levels of  agreement with each of  the 
statements are shown in the table below.

e) State Courts are effective at delivering 
justice. 15 36 30 15
f) State Courts resolve cases timely and 
promptly. 12 28 32 23
The most positive assessment of  state courts relates to accessibility. The survey 
shows that over two-thirds (68%) of  respondents feel that state courts are accessible 
to them, including one fifth (20%) who agree strongly with this statement. However, 
29 percent do not feel that they can access state courts easily. More urban dwellers 
Afghanistan in 200986
agree that state courts are accessible to them (76%) than their rural counterparts 
(66%), and more men (73%) than women (63%) say the same. 
Do you agree or disagree with “State courts are accessible to me”? (Q-95a, Base 6406) BY GEN-
DER AND SETTLEMENT
Fig 6.1
The proportion of  respondents who say that state courts are accessible to them also 
rises with level of  education. Only 65 percent of  respondents who never went to 
school agree with this statement as compared to around 70 percent who attended 
secondary school and 80 percent who completed secondary or higher education.
Around half  of  respondents agree that state courts are fair and trusted (50%), follow 
the local norms and values of  the people (49%), and are effective at delivering justice 
(51%). Respondents in urban areas tend to have a more positive assessment of  state 
courts than those in rural areas.
Opinion is almost equally divided about whether state courts are not corrupt com-
pared to other options for settling disputes. Just under half  (47%) of  respondents 
agree with this statement, and almost the same proportion (48%) disagree. This is 
consistent with the finding that around half  (51%) of  those who have had contacts 
with the judiciary and courts in the past year report having encountered some in-
stance of  corruption (see Chapter 5, 5.5: Corruption, Table 5.4).
However, only 40 percent of  respondents agree that state courts resolve cases timely 
and promptly. The majority (55%) disagree with this statement, including around a 
quarter (23%) who strongly disagree. Indeed, respondents show the greatest levels of  
dissatisfaction with this aspect of  the performance of  state courts.

Respondents in the North West, East and Central/Kabul regions consistently give 
a more positive assessment of  state courts across all domains, whereas the lowest 
levels of  satisfaction are recorded in the South West.
The high level of  ambivalence about the performance of  state courts with regard to 
their fairness, honesty, effectiveness and timeliness is consistent with the relatively 
low level of  trust respondents report in the state justice system compared to other 
public institutions (see Chapter 2, 2.6: Confidence in specific institutions and organizations, 
Table 2.3).
Satisfaction with the performance of  state courts in all these areas has fallen since 2007, 
however, there have been no substantial shifts in opinion between 2008 and 2009.

Respondents were also asked: “If  you were a victim of  violence or any criminal act, 
how much confidence would you have that the governmental law-enforcing organi-
zations and judicial system would punish the guilty party?” Over half  of  respondents 
(57%) say they would have a significant level of  confidence in the formal justice 
system to do this, while 41 percent say they would have little or no confidence in-
cluding 18 percent who say they would have no confidence at all. This reveals that a 
sizeable proportion of  the population does not believe that the state’s formal justice 
system is able to bring the guilty party to justice. This finding mirrors those of  2007 
and 2008.

Confidence in the formal justice system is particularly low in the South East, West 
and South West where around half  of  respondents have little or no confidence that 
state law enforcing organizations and the judicial system would punish the guilty 
party. These are also the regions which report the highest levels of  insecurity (see 
Chapter 3, 3.1 Security Situation) which suggests the poor capacity of  the state to en-
force the rule of  law in these areas.

6.3 Perceptions of local shura and jirga
To assess the differences between perceptions of  formal and informal justice mech-
anisms, respondents were asked about the quality and performance of  local jirga and 
shura in the same way they had been asked about state courts. Levels of  agreement 
with each of  the statements are summarized in the table below.

As with state courts, local jirga and shura are assessed most positively regarding their 
accessibility. More than three-quarters (79%) of  respondents agree that shura/jirga 
are accessible to them. Also like state courts, more men (84%) than women (74%) 
say local shura/jirga are accessible to them. However, unlike the courts, more rural 
respondents (81%) agree with this statement than urban residents (76%).

Over two-thirds of  respondents agree that local shura/jirga are fair and trusted 
(72%), follow the local norms and values of  the people (70%) and are effective at 
delivering justice (69%). All of  these figures are considerably higher than those re-
corded for state courts, where between 50 and 60 percent of  respondents agree with 
these statements. If  urban residents have more positive views toward state courts, 
rural residents give more positive assessments of  local shura/jirga. There are also 
differences between regions. More than four-fifths (84%) of  respondents in the 
North West say that local shura/jirga are fair and trusted, compared with less than 
two thirds who say the same in the West (64%) and South West (65%).

As with state courts, assessments of  local shura/jirga are least positive with regard 
to their timeliness and promptness. Around two-thirds (64%) of  respondents agree 
that local jirga/shura resolve cases promptly. However, this is significantly higher 
than the proportion who say the same about state courts (40%). 
Since 2007, positive assessments of  local jirga/shura have fallen slightly, although 
responses in 2009 show some improvement in the public’s assessment of  the tradi-
tional justice system compared to 2008.

The table below compares people’s assessments of  state courts and shura/jirga. On 
all five counts the traditional justice system is seen to fare better than the modern 
state justice system. In addition, although positive assessment of  both the formal 
and informal justice systems have declined since 2007, the drop in satisfaction has 
been more severe regarding the performance of  state courts than it has for shura 
and jirga.

Overall, these results demonstrate that many Afghans continue to view traditional 
dispute resolution mechanisms such as jirga and shura more positively than the mod-
ern formal justice system such as state courts. These findings corroborate the higher 
levels of  public confidence recorded for shura and jirga (67% confidence) than for 
the state justice system (46% confidence) (see Chapter 2, 2.6: Confidence in specific institu-
tions and organizations, Table 2.3). 
Afghanistan in 200992
However, a poor assessment of  state courts does not automatically imply a posi-
tive assessment of  traditional justice mechanisms. Respondents who give a positive 
assessment of  state courts often give a similarly positive assessment of  local jirga/
shura in the same domains. For example, the North West region records the most 
positive assessments of  both formal and informal justice mechanisms. This suggests 
that people do not see formal and informal justice mechanisms as rival institutions 
but rather take them both as possible options for accessing justice.  
6.4 Dispute resolution
In addition to examining perceptions of  formal and informal justice mechanisms in 
dealing with crime, the survey sought to examine public opinion of  these same insti-
tutions in terms of  resolving disputes within communities. Respondents were asked 
whether, in the past two years, they had a dispute or a formal case that they could 
not settle with another party and had to go to a state court or village/neighborhood 
based shura/jirga to resolve it. Around one in six respondents (16%) report having 
taken a dispute for resolution to one of  these bodies.   
A higher proportion of  men (20%) than women (10%) report taking a dispute for 
formal resolution. Likewise, more rural (18%) than urban (7%) residents report do-
ing so. A significantly higher proportion of  respondents in the South East (29%), 
East (22%), West (22%) and South West (21%) say they took a dispute to one of  
these bodies for resolution than those living in other regions.
In the past two years have you had a dispute or a formal case that you couldn’t settle with the other

Respondents who had taken disputes for resolution (16% of  all respondents) were 
then asked where they had taken their case. Just under half  (47%) say they took the 
case to a shura or jirga, while 38 percent say a state court. One in ten (10%) report 
taking their case to both institutions. Results in 2009 show that since 2007 the pro-
portion of  respondents taking cases to state courts has fallen (from 46% to 38%), 
whereas those taking cases to shura and jirga has risen (from 43% to 47%).

Respondents living in urban areas tend to go to state courts (46%), while the largest 
proportion of  those living in rural areas go to local shura or jirga (48%). Recourse to 
state courts is highest in the Central/Hazarajat region where more than two thirds 
(69%) of  respondents say they used these to resolve disputes. More respondents also 
took disputes to state courts than to informal dispute resolution mechanisms in the 
West (48%) and North West (46%). On the other hand, the majority of  respondents 
say they took their disputes to jirga or shura for resolution in the South West (60%), 
Central/Kabul (56%) and East (52%).

Respondents who have taken their case to a state court (8% of  all respondents) were 
asked a follow-up question regarding their use of  professional legal services. More 
than half  (52%) report that they pleaded their case alone or were helped by friends 
or relatives. Only 39 percent say they used the professional legal services of  a lawyer. 
Even though the proportion of  those who used legal services is small, it has grown 
significantly since 2007 (35%) and 2008 (22%).

Wherever they had taken their case, respondents were asked what kind of  case or

other than land are the second most common cause (11%), followed by commercial 
disputes (8%) and physical assault (8%).

Since 2007, disputes over land have consistently been the most common kind of  
dispute taken for resolution. However, there is a slight downward trend in the pro-
portion of  respondents approaching dispute resolution mechanisms with matters of  
an essentially criminal nature that could be dealt with by the police, such as physical 
assault (from 10% in 2007 to 8% in 2009), robbery/burglary (from 9% in 2007 to 
6% in 2009) and pick-pocketing (from 2% in 2007 to 1% in 2009). The exception to 
this is murder which concerns around 5% of  cases taken for dispute resolution.

The data also reveals is that there is no substantive difference between the kinds of  
cases taken to state courts and shura/jirga. Slightly more respondents have gone to 
state courts (56%) than to shura/jirga (54%) to resolve disputes over land, whereas 
more respondents have gone to state courts (10%) than local shura/jirga (7%) to 
resolve commercial disputes. Where such problems are taken to a dispute resolution 
body,  informal justice system seems to be preferred for resolving cases of  robbery 
or burglary (7% are taken to shura/jirga compared to 4% to state courts) and physi-
cal assault (10% taken to shura/jirga compared to 7% taken to state courts).

Finally, respondents who have referred a dispute for resolution to either formal or 
informal institutions (16% of  all respondents) were asked whether they are satis-
fied with the outcome of  the proceedings. Half  of  respondents (50%) say they are 
satisfied while a third (33%) say they are not. These figures show a fall in satisfac-
tion since 2007 when 59 percent of  respondents said they were satisfied with the 
outcome of  their case. There has been no change since 2008.
Levels of  satisfaction are slightly higher amongst respondents who have taken 
cases to local shura/jirga (55%) than those who have taken their case to the 
state courts (51%). 
The highest levels of  satisfaction are reported in the East (69%). Also, the majority 
of  respondents say they are satisfied with the outcome of  their cases in the Central/
Kabul (55%), South East (50%), West (49%), South West (50%) and Central/Haz-
arajat (50%). It is interesting to note that in most of  these regions more people take 
their cases to local shura or jirga for resolution than to state courts. Only in the West 
and the Central/Hazarajat do more people use formal rather than informal dispute 
resolution mechanisms.
Justice System 97
However, results in 2009 show that over time the proportion of  respondents who 
report being satisfied with the outcomes of  cases taken to shura/jirga continues 
to fall (from 67% in 2007 and 65% in 2008, to 55% in 2009), whereas those who 
say they are not satisfied has almost doubled between 2007 (16%) and 2009 (30%). 
Indeed, the difference in levels of  satisfaction between the outcomes of  cases taken 
to formal and informal dispute resolution mechanisms is much smaller now than in 
previous years.

Democratic Values 99
7 Democratic Values
7.1 Perceptions of democracy
Afghan political actors and the international community have worked towards re-
storing democratic government in Afghanistan since the fall of  the Taliban in 2001. 
For this reason, since 2004, the survey has sought to examine how Afghans under-
stand and perceive democracy and how these perceptions are changing over time. 
In order to ascertain whether Afghans think they will gain any perceptible ben-
efits from the introduction of  democracy to the country, respondents were asked 
to identify the most important thing that democracy in Afghanistan will bring them 
personally. They were allowed to mention more than one response. Half  (50%) of  
respondents mention freedom and 41 percent say peace as the greatest personal 
benefits they expect from democracy. These responses highlight the expectation of  
many Afghans that the consolidation of  democracy will end war, conflict and inse-
curity. They also indicate that public perceptions of  the success of  the democratic 
system are closely related to its ability to ensure freedom and peace. 
Significant numbers of  respondents also mention aspects of  good governance and 
the rule of  law as benefits they expect to gain from democracy. These include rights 
and law (24%), women’s right (21%), government of  the people (19%) and less 
corruption (17%). Nearly a quarter (23%) specifically mention Islamic democracy, 
highlighting the importance respondents place on the integration of  democratic 
practices and values with other core values in Afghan society. A small proportion of  
respondents mention material benefits such as prosperity (15%).

Although peace and freedom have consistently been the most commonly mentioned 
benefits of  democracy identified by survey respondents, a significantly higher pro-
portion mention these in 2009 than in previous years, indicating that these issues 
have gained greater importance for Afghans in the last year. Indeed, the proportion 
of  respondents who mention peace as the most important benefit of  democracy has 
increased from 34 percent in 2007, 35 percent in 2008 to 41 percent in 2009. The 
proportion who have mentioned freedom has moved up from 30 percent in 2007 to 
50 percent in 2009. Responses in 2009 also appear to reverse the trend of  the last few 
years with people giving greater importance in this year’s survey to core democratic 
values such as rights and law, women’s rights and Islamic democracy, but showing 
less confidence in the likelihood of  democracy delivering more tangible benefits 
such as less corruption or prosperity.

Respondents were then presented with some general statements about democracy 
and asked to give their views. The first statement said: “Democracy may have its 
problems, but it is better than any other form of  government”. Over three-quarters 
(78%) of  respondents say they agree with this statement, including almost a third 
(31%) who agree strongly, while only around one in seven (16%) disagree. This 
closely matches the findings in 2008.  
More women (81%) agree with this statement than men (76%). Agreement is also 
slightly higher in the younger age ranges than amongst older peoples (80% amongst

those aged 18-24 compared to 76% amongst those aged over 55). More urban dwell-
ers (83%) than rural residents (77%) agree. There are also significant differences 
between regions. More than four out of  five respondents say that democracy is the 
best available form of  government in the North West (86%), Central/Kabul (83%) 
and North East (82%) regions. However, almost a quarter say they disagree in the 
South East (24%), East (22%) and South West (22%). 
Respondents were then asked for their reaction to the statement: “Politicians seek 
power for their own benefit and don’t worry about helping people”. Three quar-
ters of  respondents (75%) also agree with this statement, including 41 percent who 
strongly agree. 
Since 2006, there has been a clear drop in the proportion of  respondents who agree 
that democracy is the best form of  government available (from 84% in 2006 to 78% 
in 2009). The proportion of  respondents who say that politicians only serve their own 
interests has also declined, but to a much smaller degree (from 79% in 2006 to 75% in 
2009). Thus, while responses indicate falling confidence in democracy as a system, the 
decline in confidence seems to be more closely related to the inability of  the system to 
fulfill the expectations of  Afghan citizens in delivering the desired benefits.

The growing disenchantment with the democratic system is further demonstrated 
by respondents’ answers to the direct question asking how satisfied or dissatisfied 
they are with the way democracy works in Afghanistan. More than two-thirds of  
respondents (68%) say that they are satisfied, including one fifth (20%) who are very 
satisfied. However, over a quarter (28%) are either somewhat or very dissatisfied. 
Again, since 2006 there has been a steady fall in the proportion of  respondents who 
say they are satisfied with the way democracy works in their country (from 76% in 
2006, to 73% in 2007 and 68% in 2008 and 2009). This has been accompanied by a 
corresponding rise in those who say they are dissatisfied (from 21% in 2006 to 25% 
in 2007 to 27% in 2008 and 28% in 2009).

Again, satisfaction is higher amongst women (72%) than men (63%), amongst those 
aged 18-24 (70%) compared to those over 55 (65%) and amongst urban dwellers (74%) 
as compared to rural residents (65%). This closely mirrors attitudes related to democ-
racy as the best available form of  government. Satisfaction with the way democracy is 
working in the country is also highest in the North West (80%), followed by the North 
East (75%) and East (74%). The proportion of  respondents reporting dissatisfaction 
is highest in the South East (43%), South West (43%) and West (32%) of  the country. 
These are also the regions where insecurity is identified as a major local problem (See 
Chapter 2, 2.5 Afghanistan’s biggest problems: Local level), and therefore where the expected 
benefits of  democracy such as peace and freedom are least evident. 
7.2 Attitudes toward democratic principles, processes and political activities
The survey endeavored to assess public attitudes regarding a number of  fundamen-
tal principles associated with democratic governance. A series of  statements was 
read out and respondents were asked to say whether they agree or disagree with 
them. A summary of  responses is presented in the table below.

Democratic Values 103
More than four-fifths of  respondents (81%) agree with the statement: “The govern-
ment should include representatives from all major regions and ethnic groups in the 
country”. However, levels of  support for this statement vary significantly between 
regions. Over four in five respondents agree with this statement in the North West 
(88%), Central/Kabul (84%) and South East (84%) regions, whereas around a quar-
ter of  respondents in the West (23%) and South West (23%) disagree. There is no 
significant difference in views between different ethnic groups.
A similar proportion (80%) agree with the statement: “Everyone should have equal 
rights under the law, regardless of  their gender, ethnicity, or religion”. Interestingly, 
slightly more men (81%) than women (79%) say they agree with this statement. 
However, there are more significant differences in views between ethnic groups. 
More than four-fifths of  Hazara (87%), Tajik (84%) and Uzbek (81%) respondents 
agree with this statement, as compared to three-quarters of  Pashtuns (75%) and 
other ethnic groups (75%).  On a regional level, more than four-fifths of  respon-
dents agree with this statement in all regions except the South West where this is true 
for just over half  (59%). Moreover, 38 percent of  respondents in the South West say 
they disagree, which is more than twice the proportion recorded in other regions. 
Overall agreement with the principle of  equal rights continues to fall over time (from 
90% in 2006 and 2007 to 84% in 2008 and to 80% in 2009).
More than three-quarters of  respondents (77%) say they agree that: “It is a good 
thing that the government should allow peaceful opposition”. Public support for 
allowing peaceful opposition is highest in the Central/Kabul region (85%) and over 
70 percent agree with this statement in all other regions except the Central/Hazarajat 
(67%). However, levels of  disagreement are highest in the East (28%) and South 
East (24%), followed by the Central/Hazarajat (23%), West (21%) and South West 
(21%). Here too, levels of  support for allowing peaceful opposition has fallen over 
the years. In 2006, 84 percent of  respondents agreed with this statement. This fell to 
81 percent in 2007, 78 percent in 2008 and 77 percent in 2009.
The survey also asked a number of  questions related to basic democratic practices. 
In this regard, respondents were asked whether political parties should be allowed 
to hold meetings in their area. Just over half  (54%) say that political parties should 
be allowed to hold meetings, while more than a third (37%) say that they should not. 
However, unlike the previous statements which show falling support for fundamen-
tal democratic values, the proportion of  respondents who are in favor of  allowing 
key democratic processes such as local meetings of  political parties increased signifi-
cantly between  2008 (44%) and 2009 (54%), almost reaching the level recorded in 
2006 (57%) (the year that followed election years in 2004 and 2005). This is accom-

panied by a corresponding fall in opposition to local political party meetings (from 
47% in 2007 to 43% in 2008 and 37% in 2009). 
Do you think that political parties should be allowed to hold meetings in your area? (Q -55) COM-
PARISON BETWEEN 2006, 2007, 2008 AND 2009

Respondents were also asked whether they think that all political parties, even the 
ones most people do not like, should be allowed to hold meetings in their area. Only 
a third (34%) of  respondents say this should be the case, while the majority (57%) 
disagree. Here too, responses in 2009 reverse the trend that was seen in previous 
years with more respondents than ever expressing support for this idea. Agreement 
fell from 32 percent in 2006 to 31 percent in 2007 and 29 percent in 2008, but rose 
to 34 percent in 2009. Support for allowing the activity of  all political parties is high-
est in the East (42%), but lowest in the North West (28%), North East (27%) and 
South East (30%).
Responses to this question are also influenced by level of  education. While 32 per-
cent of  those who never went to school agree with this statement, this rises to 38 
percent of  respondents who have completed tenth grade or beyond.
Finally, the survey sought to ascertain whether differences in political party affiliation 
could have an impact on interpersonal relationships. Respondents were asked: “Sup-
pose a friend of  yours supported a party you do not like. Would you accept that, or 
would it end your friendship?” Just under half  (48%) of  respondents say they would 
accept the situation while 40 percent say that this would end the friendship.

A clear majority of  respondents in the East (66%) and South West (58%) say they 
would accept such a difference in opinion, whereas the majority in the North East 
(56%) say that this would end their friendship.  
Over time, acceptance of  differences in political allegiances between individuals has 
been declining. Those who say they would accept such a situation has fallen from the 
majority in 2006 (54%) and 2007 (54%) to 48 percent in 2009, whereas those who 
say this would end their friendship has risen from 38 percent in 2006 to 40 percent 
in 2009.

7.3 Personal efficacy: Influence of individuals on government
The survey sought to measure the degree of  influence people think they can have 
over government decisions. More than half  (56%) of  respondents feel they can have 
a significant degree of  influence over government decisions, while more than a third 
(38%) say they do not have much influence, including a fifth of  respondent (21%) 
who say they have no influence at all. 
The results of  the 2009 survey are close to the figures recorded in 2006 and 2007 
However, they do show a small but significant trend towards greater confidence in 
personal efficacy over time. The proportion of  respondents who say they can have

“some” influence over government decisions has been rising steadily (from 35% in 
2006 to 42% in 2009). Similarly, the proportions who say they have very little or no 
influence have been falling. 
How much influence do you think someone like you can have over government decisions? (Q-63) 
COMPARISON BETWEEN 2006, 2007, 2008 AND 2009
Fig 7.5
Respondents in rural areas are still less likely to say they can influence decision mak-
ing (54%) than urban residents (60%). Similarly, as has been noted in previous years, 
confidence in personal efficacy rises with level of  education. Just over half  (54%) of  
respondents who have never been to school say they can have some level of  influ-
ence on government decisions, but this rises to around 60 percent amongst those 
who have completed some degree of  secondary education. However, there is no 
significant difference between men (56%) and women (55%) in their perceptions of  
their ability to influence government decisions. 
The highest levels of  confidence in the ability to influence government decisions are 
recorded in the East where two thirds of  respondents (66%) say they can have some 
level of  influence, whereas only 42 percent of  respondents say this in the South East. 
On the other hand, more than half  (55%) of  respondents in the South East say they 
have little or no influence on government decisions, including almost a third (29%) 
who say they can have no influence at all.

7.4 Attitudes toward elections
The survey also attempted to assess people’s sense of  efficacy to influence public 
decision-making specifically through the electoral process. Respondents were asked 
whether they think that voting can lead to improvements in the future or whether 
they believe no matter how one votes things will never change. More than two-thirds 
(70%) say that voting can change things, while just over one-fifth (22%) say that 
things are not going to get better regardless of  how they vote.
Although there has been a steady decline in the proportion of  people who have con-
fidence in the efficacy of  their vote between 2006 and 2008, results in 2009 reveal a 
certain renewed confidence in the electoral process. While three-quarters (75%) of  
respondents said they believe that voting can change things in 2006, this had fallen to 
72 percent in 2007 and around two-thirds (65%) in 2008. However, in 2009 the figure 
rose again to 70 percent of  respondents who say that voting can lead to improvements 
in the future. This may be a reflection of  the fact that 2009 is an election year. This 
finding is also consistent with the slight increase in positive assessments of  the perfor-
mance of  the central government and the parliament recorded in 2009 (see Chapter 5, 
5.1 Performance of  National Government & 5.6 Role of  elected representative bodies).

Attitudes in this regard vary between regions. The highest levels of  confidence on 
voting are in the North East and North West where around 80 percent of  respon-
dents think that voting can change things. This is also true for 75 percent of  respon-
dents in the East and 72 percent in the Central/Kabul region. However, just over 
half  (55%) of  respondents in the South West believe in the efficacy of  voting to 
bring about improvement.

It is interesting to note, that across almost all regions, respondents express higher 
levels of  confidence that voting can change things than they do in their own ability 
to influence government decision-making. Only in the South West do slightly more 
respondents think they can have influence (57%) than believe that voting can bring 
about change (55%).

Some light may be cast on this apparent paradox by the answers to a set of  further 
question related to the ways in which individuals should use their vote. When re-
spondents were asked their opinion about the statement: “A person should vote the 
way his or her community votes, not how they feel individually”, the majority (59%) 
say they agree. Just over a third (36%) of  respondents think that voting should be 
based on personal preferences. More men (61%) than women (57%) agree with 
this statement and agreement is also higher amongst rural (61%) than urban (55%) 
respondents. More respondents over 45 (62%) agree with this statement than those 
under 24 (58%). The majority of  respondents agree with this statement in all regions 
except the Central/Hazarajat (48%). However, support for voting according to com-

munity preferences fell significantly between 2008 (65%) and 2009 (59%).  Similarly, 
only a small majority (57%) of  respondents say that women should decide for them-
selves who how to vote (see Chapter 8. 8.3 Women’s political participation).
7.5 Electoral participation
The survey also sought to measure public awareness regarding the elections in Af-
ghanistan scheduled in 2009. The survey was conducted in June 2009 and the Presi-
dential and Provincial Councils elections were scheduled for August. Respondents 
were asked if  they are aware of  the upcoming elections due to take place in the next 
few months. An overwhelming majority (82%) said they were aware, but nearly one 
in six respondents (16%) said they were not. Levels of  awareness were higher among 
men (85%) than women (78%).

When people had been asked about their awareness of  the 2009 elections the previ-
ous year, just over half  (53%) of  respondents had said they were aware. The fact that 
more than four-fifths (82%) of  respondents were aware of  the upcoming elections 
in June 2009 suggests that efforts to increase public awareness about the elections 
have been largely successful. 
Respondents were also asked whether they had received any information regarding the 
elections or regarding their participation in the elections in the previous days or weeks. 
Half  (50%) of  respondents said they had received such messages while just under half  
Democratic Values 111
(48%) said they had not. More rural residents (51%) than urban dwellers (44%) said 
they received information. Nearly two-thirds of  respondents in the East (63%), and 
more than half  in the North West (59%) and North East (55%) reported having re-
ceived such messages. However, more than half  of  respondents in the Central/Kabul 
(59%), South West (55%) and Central/Hazarajat (53%) regions said they had not.
Respondents who were aware of  the elections were then asked to identify their main 
source of  electoral information. The most commonly mentioned source of  infor-
mation was radio (44%) followed by TV (25%), then followed by friends, family and 
neighbors (16%). Radio was the most common source of  information on elections 
for rural residents (49%), while most urban dwellers (61%) said they get their elec-
tion information from TV. This is also consistent with national patterns of  media 
usage (see Chapter 9, 9.4: Sources of  information on national and local events). The Central/
Kabul region is the only region where the majority of  respondents identified TV as 
their main source of  information. Radio remains the main source of  information in 
the rest of  the country.   
The survey also asked all respondents whether they had registered to vote in the 2009 
elections. Just over three quarters (77%) of  respondents said they had done so, while 
around one in five (21%) said they had not. While more than four-fifths (85%) of  
men said they had registered, this was true for just over two-thirds (69%) of  women. 
A lower proportion of  respondents on higher incomes had registered to vote than 
those in lower income brackets. While more than four-fifths (83%) of  respondents 
who earn less than 2000 Afs a month had registered, only around three-quarters 
(76%) of  respondents who earn more than 3,000 Afs a month had done so.  
Respondents with higher levels of  education were also more likely to have registered to 
vote. Almost nine out of  ten (89%) respondents who have completed high school and 
four-fifths (81%) of  those who have some level of  secondary education had registered. 
This fell to under three-quarters (73%) of  respondents who never went to school.

The survey asked those respondents who said they had not registered for the elec-
tions (21% of  all respondents) whether they knew where to register to vote. Only 
around one in five (22%) said they did, while about three-quarters (73%) said they 
did not, suggesting that lack of  information about electoral procedures may still 
constitute a significant reason why Afghans may have failed to register to vote. Only 
half  as many women (17 %) as men (31%) said they knew where to register to vote. 
Respondents were then asked how likely they were to vote. Around three-quarters 
(73%) said they were likely to vote, including almost half  (48%) who said this was 
very likely. However, one in five (20%) said they were unlikely to vote, including one 
in seven (14%) who said this was very unlikely. Considerably more men (53%) than 
women (41%) said they were very likely to vote. These results suggest that the dis-
parity in electoral participation between men and women that was seen in the 2004 
and 2005 elections was likely to be repeated in the elections in August 2009.

More than four out of  five respondents said they were likely to vote in the Central/
Hazarajat (87%), East (85%), North East (83%) and North West (82%). However, 
more than one in three respondents in the South West (35%) and at least one in 
four in the South East (29%), Central/Kabul (27%) and West (25%) said they were 
unlikely to vote.  
Respondents who said they were unlikely to vote in the upcoming elections (20% of  
all respondents) were then asked why this was so. A quarter of  respondents (26%) 
said this was because they are not interested. Security concerns (18%) were the sec-
ond most commonly cited reason. 
Lack of  interest was the most common reason cited by respondents in the Central/
Kabul (35%), East (23%), North East (28%), North West (33%) and West (25%), 
while insecurity was the main reason identified in the South East (25%) and South 
West (30%). 
The proportion of  respondents who report having no interest in participating in the 
elections has more than doubled since 2004 (from 12% to 16% in 2005, 18% in 2008 
and 26% in 2009). 
More than a quarter (26%) of  women who said they were unlikely to vote said this 
was because they would not be permitted to vote. No men mentioned this as a reason. 
More than a third (34%) of  respondents in the Central/Hazarajat region said that this 
was the reason they were unlikely to vote making it the most frequently mentioned 
reason in this region. Given that this region registered the highest level of  intentions 
to vote, it seems likely that it was mostly women in the Central/Hazarajat who were 
excluded from the electoral process. However, just under a quarter of  respondents in 
the North East (23%) and Central/Kabul (22%) also said this was because they would 
not be permitted to vote, more than twice as many as in the other regions.

Respondents were also asked whether they thought the upcoming elections would be 
free and fair. Before asking this question, respondents were briefed about what the 
terms ‘free’ and ‘fair’ mean in this regard. In an electoral context ‘free’ means that all 
people have the chance to vote as they wish and that they are not forced to vote for 
a particular party or candidate. ‘Fair’ means that all candidates and parties are given 
equal access to public channels of  communications, that they are not prevented from 
getting their message across to voters and that votes cast are counted correctly and 
results are not manipulated. Just under two-thirds (64%) of  respondents said that 
the upcoming elections would be free and fair, while around a fifth (22%) said they 
would not. Doubts about the elections being free and fair were highest in the South 
West (37%), South East (29%), Central/Kabul (25%) and West (23%).  
Do you think the upcoming elections will be free and fair, or do you think they will not be free and 
fair? (Q-75, Base 6406) BY REGION
Fig 7.15
Respondents who said that the coming elections would not be free and fair (22% of  
all respondents) were also asked for the reason. Well over a third (39%) said there 
would be cheating in the vote count, while another third (33%) mentioned buying of  
votes. Just under one in ten (9%) said that husbands will not let their wives vote, and 
a similar proportion (8%) mentioned intimidation against voters or party activists. 
When responses about the likelihood of  the elections being free and fair are analyzed 
alongside voting intentions a clear correlation emerges.  Respondents who are likely 
to vote are also those who believe that the elections will be free and fair. More than

three-quarters (77%) of  respondents who are very likely to vote also think the elec-
tions will be free and fair. The same is true for around two-thirds (64%) of  respon-
dents who are somewhat likely to vote. However, well under half  (43%) of  those 
who are somewhat unlikely to vote think that the elections will be free and fair, and 
this is true for an even smaller proportion (38%) of  those who are very unlikely to 
vote. This indicates that confidence in the integrity of  the electoral process has a sig-
nificant impact on people’s willingness to participate is these democratic processes.

Another factor that influences people’s decision to vote is the belief  that their votes 
will bring about change. Those who are likely to vote in the upcoming election are 
those people who believe in the efficacy of  their vote to achieve improvement. A 
much higher proportion of  those who say they are very likely to vote (84%) and 
somewhat likely to vote (71%) think that voting can change things, compared to 
those who are somewhat unlikely to vote (46%) and very unlikely to vote (43%). This 
suggests that people are likely to use their voting rights if  they believe that voting can 
lead to improvement and changes in the future.

7.6 Freedom of expression
The survey also sought to measure pubic opinion on freedom of  expression as an-
other cornerstone of  democratic practice. Respondents were asked whether most 
people feel free to express their political opinions in their local area. Forty percent 
of  respondents say they do but an almost equal proportion (39%) say they do not. 
Around one in five respondents (18%) is either unable or unwilling to give an opin-
ion. These percentages have not changed significantly since 2007. 
However there are significant regional differences.  Over half  of  respondents in the 
East (53%), and more than forty percent in the North West (48%), Central/Hazarajat 
(45%), North East (44%) and Central/Kabul (43%) regions say that people feel free to 
express their political opinion in their local areas. In contrast, over half  of  respondents 
in the South West (53%) and South East (52%) and 43 percent in the West say that 
this is not the case. In addition, at least a quarter of  respondents in the West (27%) 
and Central/Hazarajat (25%) and at least a fifth in the North West (22%) and Central/
Kabul (20%) regions, are unable or unwilling to express an opinion in this regard.

Respondents who say that most people feel free to express their political opinions in 
their local area (40% of  all respondents) were then asked what changes or reasons 
have made this possible. Respondents were invited to give two reasons. More than 
half  (55%) of  respondents say this is because freedom of  speech is guaranteed. 
Over a third (37%) mention good security conditions in their areas. Around one in 
seven respondents say the reason is peace and democracy (14%) or the removal of  
local militias (14%). This suggests that physical security conditions, as well as the 
legal guarantee of  freedoms, are important in ensuring freedom of  expression for 
citizens. A third of  respondents (33%) do not identify any particular factor to which 
they could attribute freedom of  expression in their area.

Respondents who say that most people do not feel free to express their political opin-
ions in their area (39% of  all respondents) were also asked why they think this is so. 
They were invited to mention two reasons. Physical security conditions account for 
the overwhelming majority of  responses including fear for safety (34%), bad security 
conditions (29%), presence of  the Taliban (21%) and presence of  warlords (7%). In 
addition, 40 percent of  respondents do not give a definitive answer to this question 
which also suggests a level of  concern about the possible consequences of  doing so. 
The lack of  guaranteed rights also features prominently amongst responses including 
the government not allowing freedom of  political opinions (12%), women being under 
the control of  men (9%) and government not taking note of  people’s opinions (9%).

The proportion of  respondents who identify fear for their safety and bad security 
conditions as the reason for lack of  freedom of  expression in their area has fallen in 
2009 compared to 2008. Indeed, the proportion mentioning poor local security con-
ditions is lower in 2009 (29%) than in any previous year (40% in 2006, 36% in 2007, 
38% in 2008).  The proportion of  respondents who explicitly mention a threat from 
the Taliban had fluctuated substantially since 2006, but has risen in 2009 (21%) com-
pared to 2008 (18%), whereas those who mention the presence of  warlords continues 
to fall (from 32% in 2006 to 18% in 2007, 8% in 2008 and 7% in 2009). Twelve per-
cent of  the respondents mention government prohibition of  freedom of  political ex-
pression in 2009 as opposed to 15 percent in 2008, 22 percent in 2007 and 17 percent 
in 2006. On the other hand, more than twice as many respondents have mentioned 
women being under the control of  men as a reason for limited freedom of  expression 
in 2009 (9%) and 2008 (10%) as in 2006 (4%) or 2007 (4%).

7.7 Democratic spirit of government 
In order to assess how citizens relate to the government, the survey asked all respon-
dents to say whether they agree or disagree with a number of  statements related to 
the application of  democratic principles. The first statement was: “I don’t think the 
government cares much about what people like me think”. Around three quarters 
of  respondents (74%) agree with this statement including over a quarter (28%) who 
strongly agree. Just under a quarter (22%) disagree with the statement.

The second statement was: “It is generally not acceptable to talk negatively about 
the Government in public”. Sixty-one percent of  respondents agree with this state-
ment including 23 percent who strongly agree. Over a third (35%) disagree. A higher 
proportion of  residents in the South West (43%) and South East (41%) say it is 
acceptable to talk negatively about the government than in other regions. These are 
also the regions that report the highest levels of  dissatisfaction with government 
performance (see Chapter 5, 5.1 Performance of  National Government).

Over time there have been small fluctuations in the proportion of  respondents who 
say that the government does not care about the views of  people like them. How-
ever, there has been a consistent fall in the proportion of  respondents who say it is 
unacceptable to talk negatively about the government (from 69% in 2007 to 61% 
in 2009). This is significant given that the proportion of  respondents who say that 
people feel free to express their political opinions in their local area has not changed 
significantly over this period (see section 7.6 first paragraph). These findings confirm that 
the major obstacles to freedom of  expression in Afghanistan do not come from the 
government but from other factors in the environment and society.

7.8 Involvement of religious leaders
Finally, the survey sought to assess public opinion regarding the involvement of  
religious leaders in government decision making. Respondents were offered two al-
ternative viewpoints: “Some people argue that local religious leaders should be regu-
larly consulted on the problems facing an area while others argue that politics and 
religion should not mix”, and asked which is closer to their view. About two-thirds 
of  respondents (67%) say that religious leaders should be consulted while around 
a quarter (27%) say that politics and religion should not mix. The proportion of  
respondents who say religious leaders should be consulted has been higher in 2008 
and 2009 than it was in 2006 and 2007, when only around 60 percent of  respondents 
were in favor of  such consultation. 
Some people say that local religious leaders should be regularly consulted on the problems facing an 
area while others think that politics and religion should not mix. Which is closer to your view? 
(Q-66) COMPARISON BETWEEN 2006, 2007, 2008 AND 2009
Fig 7.20
Public opinion in this regard varies between regions. Although the majority of  re-
spondents in all regions are in the favor of  consulting with religious leaders, this 
is true for a much higher proportion of  people in the East (82%) and South West 
(72%) of  the country than in other regions. Opposition to the involvement of  re-
ligious leaders is highest in the West where a third of  respondents (32%) say that 
politics and religion should not mix.

Fig 7.21
Despite the relatively low levels of  support for the view that politics and religion 
should not mix, 71 percent of  respondents say they agree with the statement: “Re-
ligious authorities should lead people in obeying the obligations of  their faith while 
political leaders should make decisions about how the government is run”. However, 
support for the separation of  the roles of  religious authorities and political leaders 
has also fallen over the years. Over four-fifths of  respondents (82%) agreed with 
this statement in 2006. This fell to 80 percent in 2007, 75 percent in 2008 and 71 
percent in 2009. This trend is therefore consistent with the increasing support for 
consultation with religious leaders to help the government to resolve local problems 
(see Fig.7.20).

8 Women and Society
8.1 The biggest problems faced by women
The survey sought to understand the particular challenges faced by women in Afghan 
society. All respondents (men and women) were asked to identify the two biggest 
problems women face in Afghanistan. Nearly half  (49%) of  respondents mention 
lack of  education and illiteracy. More than a quarter identify the lack of  job opportu-
nities for women (28%) and around a fifth (21%) say lack of  women’s rights.
Slightly more men (50%) than women (47%) identify lack of  education and illit-
eracy as one of  biggest problems faced by women. Men also tend to place greater 
emphasis on the availability of  basic services for women such as access to general 
healthcare (12% of  men compared to 9% of  women) and pregnancy related health-
care (10% of  men compared to 5% of  women).  However, more women mention 
lack of  job opportunities (31% compared to 26% of  men) and issues related to 
equality including lack of   women’s rights (24% of  women, 18% of  men), domestic 
violence (14% of  women, 9% of  men) and that women can’t leave their homes (10% 
of  women, 7% of  men).  
The problem of  job opportunities for women is a significantly higher priority for low 
income households. This is mentioned by 37 percent of  households with a monthly 
income of  less than 2000Afs compared to 27 percent for those earning over 3,000 
Afs a month, 24 percent for those earning over 5,000 Afs a month and 19 percent 
for those in the highest income category. Conversely, the lack of  women’s rights and 
domestic violence are more frequently identified by higher income households. 
Across the country, the lack of  education and illiteracy is identified as the biggest 
problem facing women in all regions. However, the proportion of  those who iden-
tify the lack of  job opportunities for women is particularly high in the North West 
(42%) and North East (40%). More than a fifth (21%) of  respondents identify the 
lack of  women’s rights in all regions except North East (12%) and Central/Kabul 
(16%)5. 
5  In 2009, in three provinces in the South; Paktika, Uruzghan and Zabul, women were not sampled due to the 
deteriorated security situation in the region that restricted freedom of  movement, making it unsafe to employ 
female interviewers (see Appendix 2: Methodology).

Since 2006, lack of  education has consistently been identified as the biggest problem 
for women in Afghanistan. However, over the same period there has been a con-
sistent rise in the proportion of  respondents who identify the lack of  employment 
opportunities for women as a significant issue (from 1% in 2006 to 19% in 2007, 
24% in 2008 and 28% in 2009). While concern about the lack of  women’s rights has 
remained relatively stable (fluctuating between 24% and 21% in the last four years), 
the proportion of  respondents who identify domestic violence as a major problem 
for Afghan women has declined (from 23% in 2006 to 15% in 2007, 12% in 2008 
and 11% in 2009).

8.2 Gender equality
The survey also endeavored to measure public opinion on the issue of  gender equal-
ity. Respondents were first asked whether they agree with the statement: “Women 
should have equal opportunities like men in education”. Well over four-fifths (87%) 
of  respondents say they agree with this statement, including more than half  (55%) 
who strongly agree. Only around one in eight (12%) express some level of  disagree-
ment. This finding closely matches that of  2008. 
Not surprisingly, a higher proportion of  women (92%) than men (83%) support 
equal opportunities in education. Urban residents are also more likely to support 
equal educational opportunities for women (93%) compared to their rural counter-
parts (85%). 
Across the country at least 85 percent of  respondents express support for equal 
educational opportunities for women in all regions except the South West (73%).  In 
the South West around a quarter (26%) of  respondents oppose such equality at least 
twice the figure recorded in any other region.

These responses are broadly consistent with the high level of  stated support for 
equal rights under the law, regardless of  gender, ethnicity or religion (80%) (see Chap-
ter 7, 7.2 Attitudes to democratic principles, processes and political activities).
Respondents were then asked to give their opinion on whether women should be al-
lowed to work outside the home. Just over two-thirds of  respondents (67%) say that 
women should be allowed to work outside the home, while 29 percent say that they 
should not. Public opinion in this regard has not changed significantly since 2006, 
although the proportion who say that women should be allowed to work outside the 
home has decreased marginally each year to its lowest level in 2009 (from 71% in 
2006 to 67% in 2009).

There is a considerable difference of  opinion between the sexes on whether women 
should be allowed to work outside the home. Four-fifths of  women (80%) think that 
they should, compared to just over half  (55%) of  men. Younger respondents also 
tend to be more favorable to this idea. Seventy-one percent of  respondents aged 
between 18 and 24 are in favor of  women working outside the home compared to 
only 62 percent among those aged over 55. Similarly, more urban (79%) than rural 
(64%) residents hold this opinion. Respondents with lower incomes are also more 
favorable to this idea than those in higher income categories. Sixty-nine percent of  
respondents earning less than 2000 Afs a month are in favor compared to 61 percent 
of  people earning more than 10,000 Afs. 
Support for women being allowed to work outside the home is strongest in the 
Central/Hazarajat (82%), North West (75%), Central/Kabul (73%) and North East 
(71%) regions. Opposition to this idea is strongest in the South West (49%), South 
East (38%) and East (37%) of  the country.

8. Women’s political participation
The survey attempted to ascertain whether respondents’ views on gender equality in 
general carry through into support for women’s political participation. Respondents 
were asked whether they think women should be allowed to vote in elections. A 
large majority of  respondents (83%) say that they should, demonstrating that the 
principle of  universal suffrage is broadly accepted in Afghanistan. Only 14 percent 
of  respondents disagree with women being allowed to vote. More women (88%) 
than men (79%) say women should be allowed to vote, as do more respondents in 
urban (91%) than rural (81%) areas. Likewise, those with higher levels of  education 
are more likely to support the electoral participation of  women. Eighty-eight percent 
of  respondents who have completed secondary school agree with this, compared to 
around 82 percent of  those with lower levels of  education. 
There is also variation between regions. Support for women voting is highest in the 
North West (90%), Central/Hazarajat (90%), North East (89%), Central/Kabul (88%) 
and East (83%). However, at least a third of  respondents in the South West (35%) and 
a quarter in the South East (25%) say women should not be allowed to vote.

Respondents were then asked whether they thought that, when voting in elections, 
women should decide for themselves how to vote or whether they should receive ad-
vice from men. A small majority (57%) say that women should decide for themselves, 
while around a third (23%) say men should advise them. Almost one in five respon-
dents (19%) think that women should decide for themselves, but in consultation with 
men. There has been almost no change in public opinion on this issue since 2006.

More than two-thirds of  respondents in the North West (69%), North East (67%) 
and Central/Hazarajat (67%) regions think that women should decide for them-
selves on how to vote, while almost a third of  respondents in the South East (31%), 
South West (31%) and around a quarter in the East (26%) say that women should 
be advised by men. An almost equal proportion in these three regions thinks that 
women should decide in consultation with men (28% in the South East and South 
West and 25% in the East).
Women and Society 129
Respondents were also asked whether they agree with the statement: “In the election, 
everyone must vote for themselves. Men cannot vote in place of  women. Women 
must vote for themselves”. More than four-fifths (86%) of  respondents agree with 
this statement while around one in ten (11%) disagree. Again, more women (91%) 
agree with the statement than men (83%). 
Again the same regional divergence is seen. More than four-fifths of  respondents 
agree with this statement in the North East (94%), Central/Kabul (92%), Central/
Hazarajat (90%), North West (88%), East (88%) and Western (86%). However, more 
than one in four respondents (27%) in the South West and around one in five (19%) 
in the South East say it is acceptable for men to vote in the place of  women.
Respondents’ views on women’s independent participation in electoral processes are 
clearly correlated with their other views on gender equality. 
For example, 70 percent of  respondents who think that women should be allowed 
to work outside the home also say that women should decide for themselves how 
to vote. On the other hand, 70 percent of  those who think that women should not 
be allowed to work outside the home do not think that women should be allowed to 
decide for themselves how to vote (44% of  them think men should advise and 26% 
think women should decide in consultation with men). These findings closely match 
those of  2006, 2007 and 2008.

Similarly, 61 percent of  those who agree that women should have equal opportuni-
ties in education also say that women should decide for themselves how to vote. 
On the other hand, 69 percent of  those who think that women should not have 
equal educational opportunities also do not think that women should decide for

8.4 Political leadership
The survey also asked a series of  questions pertaining to women playing leadership 
roles in politics. Respondents were first asked whether they think that political leader-
ship positions should be mostly for men, mostly for women or whether both men 
and women should have equal representation at leadership level. A little less than half  
(47%) of  respondents say that both men and women should have equal representation, 
while more than a third (39%) say leadership positions should be mostly for men, and 
just one in ten (10%) say that leadership positions should be mostly for women.
The survey shows that women have a much stronger belief  in equality of  representa-
tion than do their male counterparts. Almost twice as many women (60%) as men 
(35%) say there should be equal representation in political leadership. More than 
half  of  male respondents (54%) believe that political leadership positions should be 
mostly for men, while only around one in six (15%) female respondents think that 
leadership positions should be mostly for women.

In order to investigate public attitudes to women in political leadership roles in more 
detail, the survey asked respondents whether they are opposed to being represented 
by a woman on various governance bodies from the local to the national level. Just 
over half  of  respondents say they have no objection to being represented by a wom-
an on any of  these bodies. The only exception to this is at Provincial Council level 
where the figure is just below half  (49%).

Average 45 52
Respondents record the least opposition to being represented by a woman in their 
District Development Assembly (DDA) (54% say they have no objection while 42% 
say they are opposed). This may reflect the impact of  the systematic policy of  pro-
moting active female representation incorporated into the approach for the estab-
lishment of  DDAs. The highest levels of  opposition are at the level of  the National 
Parliament (50%) and the Provincial Council (49%). In these institutions a quota 
system has been the main mechanism for supporting women’s representation.  
There is a little difference between the responses of  men and women on this issue. On 
average, 50 percent of  men and 53 percent of  women say they have no objection to 
being represented by a woman on these bodies. There are significantly lower levels of  
objection to female representation in the Central/Hazarajat than in other regions.
However, results in 2009 show a significant decline in support for female represen-
tation compared to previous years.  The greatest fall concerns representation on a 
Provincial Council (PC). In 2008, 59 percent of  respondents had no objection to 
being represented by a women on the PC, but this has fallen to under half  (49%) in 
2009. A similar fall in support is evident regarding representation in the national par-
liament (from 57% to 50%), on a Community Development Council (58% to 52%) 
and in local shura or jirga (58% to 53%). The smallest drop concerns acceptance of  
being represented by a woman on the District Development Assembly (57% to 54%) 
which has shifted from having amongst the highest levels of  opposition to female 
representation to having the lowest level in the space of  a single year.

The table below further breaks down responses regarding female political repre-
sentation by region. Support for women taking a representative role is consistently 
highest in the Central/Hazarajat region regarding national (60%) and provincial 
(58%) level representation, and in the East in terms of  female representation at the 
community level, including District Development Assemblies (68%) and local shura 
or jirga (65%). Both regions express equally high levels of  support for women’s 
representation on Community Development Councils (60%). Support for female 
representation on governance bodies in the Central/Hazarajat region are clearly cor-
related with more general views on women’s political participation. Respondents in 
this region are amongst the most supportive of  women being able to vote (90%), 
to decide for themselves how to vote (67%) and for women being allowed to work 
outside the home (82%). The Central/Hazarajat also records the highest levels of  
support in the country for political leadership positions being shared between men 
and women (66%) (see Fig.8.7). The picture is more complex for the East region 
which records a high proportion of  respondents who say they are not opposed to 
women in leadership position in various bodies, but where nearly half  (48%) say that 
political leadership positions should be mostly for men, and more than a third (37%) 
say that women should not be allowed to work outside the home.

8.5 Awareness of the Ministry of Women’s Affairs
In 2002, the Afghan government created the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs to pro-
vide a focus for policy on gender equality and enhance the participation of  women 
in Afghan society. In 2009, for the second year, the survey attempted to measure 
public awareness of  the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs at the national and local levels. 
Respondents were first asked whether they were aware of  the government ministry 
known as the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs. More than half  (58%) of  respondents 
say that they are aware of  the Ministry, while 39 percent say they are not aware of  it. 
There has been no substantive change in the level of  awareness in the last year. 
More men (66%) than women (48%) are aware of  the existence of  this Ministry. 
This is likely to be a reflection of  the higher levels of  literacy and education amongst 
men and the greater role taken by men in public life in Afghan society.

Awareness is also greater amongst respondents with higher levels of  education. More 
than three quarters (78%) of  respondents who have completed high school and 
around two thirds of  those who have some secondary education (69%) or completed 
primary school (64%) are aware of  the existence of  the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs, 
compared to less than half  (49%) of  respondents who never went to school.
Awareness of  the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs is highest in the South East (72%) 
and Central/Kabul (71%) regions. Around half  of  respondents are aware of  the 
Ministry in the North East (53%), North West (50%), West (50%) and South West 
(57%). On the other hand, over half  of  respondents living in the East (51%) and 
Central/Hazarajat (58%) regions have not heard about the ministry.

Respondents who say they are aware of  the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs (58% of  all 
respondents) were then asked whether there are any local offices of  the ministry in 
the district or province where they live. Around 60 percent of  them say they know 
of  local offices of  this Ministry while 36 percent say they do not. Awareness of  the 
local offices of  the ministry is highest in the North East (73%), Central/Hazarajat 
(65%) and West (64%). However, half  of  respondents in the East (50%) and more 
than 40 percent in the South East (44%) and South West (41%) do not know of  any 
local offices of  the Ministry of  Women’s Affairs.
Information Sources and Media Use 137
9 Information Sources and Media Use
Since 2006, the survey has sought to explore how Afghans access and receive infor-
mation. Once again, this year, the survey examined listenership of  radio, viewership 
of  television and the way people use the media. It also assessed how Afghans access 
communications technology such as radio, television, computers, fixed phone lines 
and mobile phones and assessed their preferences for receiving information through 
these and other channels including informal community networks.  
9.1 Access to communications technology
Radio is the most accessible media for Afghan households. More than four-fifths 
(81%) of  respondents say they have a functioning radio in their household, and there 
is only a slight difference in access between urban (81%) and rural (77%) areas. How-
ever, other communications technologies are much more accessible to urban resi-
dents than to those living in rural areas. More than twice as many urban (80%) as rural 
(30%) households have access to a television. The same is true for mobile phones. 
More than four-fifths (81%) of  urban residents say they have a mobile phone while 
only 44 percent of  rural residents say so. Although only a small proportion (6%) of  
Afghan households own a computer, six times more urban (18%) than rural (3%) 
residents do so. Ownership of  functioning fixed phone line is rare in Afghanistan.

Ownership of  all kinds of  communications technology rises steadily with both in-
come and educational level. The disparity is smallest with respect to radio owner-
ship, but it is still significant. More than four-fifths (84%) of  all households earning 
over 3,000Afs a month own a radio, but this is true for just over two thirds (69%) of  
households earning under 2,000Afs. These disparities underline the challenges that 
remain in providing information through technological means to the poorer sections 
of  Afghan society.
Afghanistan in 2009138
Radio ownership is highest in the South East (96%), East (89%) and South West 
(87%). However, it is relatively low in the Central/Hazarajat (59%) and North West 
(66%) regions. Access to television is highest in the Central/Kabul region (64%) fol-
lowed by the West (47%) and North West (38%). Mobile telephone penetration is 
also highest in the Central/Kabul region (78%) followed by the East (68%), South 
East (57%) and North West (46%). The Central/Kabul region also has a significantly 
higher proportion of  households that own a computer (14%) than any other region.

Although radio continues to be the most accessible form of  communications tech-
nology in Afghanistan, the proportion of  respondents who own a functioning radio 
has been declining steadily since 2007 (from 88% to 84% in 2008 and 81% in 2009). 
On the other hand, the proportion of  respondents who own a working television 
set continues to rise (from 37% in 2007 to 38% in 2008 and 41% in 2009). However, 
the most dramatic increase has been in mobile telephone ownership which has risen 
from 42 percent in 2007 to over half  (52%) of  respondent households in 2009.

9.2 Radio listenership
The survey also sought to examine the use of  different media. Respondents were first 
asked how many days a week they listen to the radio. Forty four percent say they listen 
to the radio every day or almost every day and 21 percent say they listen three or four 
days a week. One-fifth (20%) of  respondents say they never listen to the radio.

Along with radio ownership, radio listenership has also been falling in recent years. 
In 2006, more than half  (53%) of  respondents said they listened to the radio every-
day, however, this has fallen to 44 percent in 2008 and 2009. Conversely, those who 
say they never listen to the radio has risen from one in eight respondents (12%) in 
2006 to one in five (20%) in 2009.

Respondents who say they listen to the radio (80% of  all respondents) were then 
asked for how many hours they listen on an average day. Around three in five re-
spondents (59%) say they listen for under an hour, including one in five (21%) who 
listen for less than 30 minutes. A quarter (25%) of  radio listeners listen for up to two 
hours while around one in six (16%) listen for more than two hours a day.

The survey then asked about television viewership. Respondents were asked how 
many days a week they watch TV, if  any. More than half  (56%) say they never watch 
television. This is a much more common response in rural (66%) than urban (18%) 
areas, where television ownership is much higher (see Table 9.1). Around a quarter 
(26%) say they watch television everyday or almost everyday.

Respondents who say they watch television (42% of  all respondents) were then 
asked how many hours they watch TV on an average day. The survey shows that 
people watch television for longer periods than they spend listening to the radio. 
Thirty-seven percent of  respondents watch television for less than an hour a day, 
compared to 59 percent who say the same about listening to the radio. Around a 
third of  respondents (32%) watch television for more than two hours a day, com-
pared to 16 percent who listen to the radio for the same length of  time.

9.4 Sources of information on national and local events
The survey also endeavored to ascertain public preferences regarding sources of  
information on national and local events. Respondents were first asked to identify 
their main source of  information about what is happening in the country. Just under 
half  (47%) identify radio as their main information source, while one fourth (25%) 
say TV. Around one-fifth of  respondents (18%) say they normally get information 
on national events from friends, family and neighbors. A small proportion of  re-
spondents say they prefer to get information about what is happening in the country 
from community leaders (6%) or religious leaders (2%).
Although the radio remains the most common source of  information for what is 
happening in the country, 2009 is the first year in which less than half  (47%) of  re-
spondents identify it as their main source of  information. In 2006, the figure was 55 
percent and this fell to 54 percent in 2007 and 51 percent in 2008. This is in keeping 
with the fall in radio ownership and radio listenership measured over this period.

However, radio remains the main source of  information for the majority of  rural 
residents (53%), while most urban residents identify TV (62%) as their most impor-
tant information source. Recourse to friends, family, and neighbors as the principle 
source of  information on national and local events is more than twice as high in 
rural areas (20%) as in urban areas (9%).

Women (23%) are nearly twice as likely as men (13%) to identify family, friends 
and neighbors as their preferred source of  information on current national events. 
Those with lower levels of  education also tend to rely more on family, friends and 
neighbors to get information. Significantly more respondents who never went to 
school (22%) say they get their information this way, than those who completed 
primary school (16%), those who attended high school (10%) and those who have 
completed secondary or higher education (8%).  
In order to examine in greater depth who in their communities people turn to in 
order to find out what is happening locally, the survey asked: “If  you wanted to 
find out about something important happening in your community who, outside 
your family, would you want to tell you about it?” Results show that, in general, re-
spondents prefer to get such information from personal acquaintances rather than 
leadership figures within their community. Around a quarter of  respondents (23%) 
say friends and another fifth (21%) mention neighbors or villagers. Around one in 
six (17%) say they would prefer to get this information from village chiefs or com-
munity leaders and around one in eight (13%) from a mullah. More men (19%) than 
women (15%) prefer to get their information from community leaders, as do more 
respondents living in villages (18%) than in urban areas (13%).  Fewer than one in 
ten respondents say they prefer to get this kind of  information from local radio sta-
tions (7%) or international radio stations (9%). 
Afghanistan in 2009144
However, the proportion of  respondents who say they prefer to receive informa-
tion on local events from personal acquaintances has been falling steadily in recent 
years. In 2006, around a third (34%) of  respondents said they would like to get such 
information from neighbors. This figure fell to 30 percent in 2007, a quarter (25%) 
in 2008 and a fifth (21%) in 2009. On the other hand, 2009 records the highest 
proportion of  respondents who say they prefer to get information from influential 
people such as village chiefs, community leaders or mullahs. Interestingly, although 
the popularity of  radio as a source of  general information is falling (see Table 9.4), the 
proportion of  respondents who say they use local and international radio stations to 
access local news in increasing.

The survey also attempted to ascertain how often people use different forms of  
print and electronic media such as newspaper, magazines, internet and SMS text 
messaging and informal means such as meetings in the community and sermons in 
mosques as their major source of  information about current events. The great ma-
jority of  Afghans say they never use newspapers (75 %), magazines (78%), SMS text 
messaging (81%) or the internet (97%) for this purpose. This is likely to be largely 
due to a combination of  low access to communications technologies and relatively 
low levels of  literacy amongst the Afghan population as a whole. However, the use 
of  informal means to get news and information is high. Nearly half  of  respondent 
use meetings in the community (53%) or sermons in mosques (47%) for this pur-
pose. This demonstrates that traditional means of  information dissemination con-
tinue to remain important in Afghanistan.

Despite small fluctuations, there have not been substantial changes since 2007 in 
the use of  different means of  communication for accessing information on cur-
rent events, with the exception of  the use of  SMS text messaging which has risen 
dramatically from 9 percent in 2007 and 10 percent in 2008 to 19 percent in 2009. 
This is consistent with the significant rise in mobile phone ownership in the last year 
which has meant that for the first time the majority of  respondents (52%) now have 
access to this kind of  technology (See Table 9.1).

 Appendix 2: Methodology 151
11    Appendix 2: Methodology
1.       Distribution of sampling points by region and urban/rural strata
The survey was conducted among 6406 respondents in a single wave. Fieldwork for 
the survey was conducted by the Afghan Center for Socio-economic and Opinion 
Research (ACSOR-Surveys), Kabul, between June 17 and July 6, 2009 by a team of  
648 trained interviewers (300 women and 348 men). The survey consisted of  in-
person interviews with a random, representative sample of  6406 Afghan citizens, 18 
years of  age and over and resident in Afghanistan. 
The survey included both urban and rural respondents in all provinces of  
Afghanistan. The Sheharwali (municipal administration in Afghanistan) defines the 
urban population as those living within municipal boundaries. By default, the rural 
population comprises those who are living outside the municipal limits.  Rural areas 
are defined neither in terms of  population density nor remoteness.  
The country is divided into eight geographical regions covering all 34 provinces. The 
sample was distributed proportional to geographic and residential characteristics of  
the population in each province. Within each province, districts were selected by first 
listing them by size of  population and then applying a random selection method 
from this list. 
For provinces with low population density, such as Nimroz, Panjshir and Nooristan, 
five interviews per sampling point were conducted, rather than eight as in other 
provinces, to offer broader geographic distribution. 
The margin of  sampling error is calculated at a cumulative of  +/-3.7 percent at 95 
percent confidence interval. The stochastic error is +/-2.4 percent while the systemic 
error is +/- 1.3 percent. The systemic error appears because of  the areas not accessible 
for surveying this year. The systemic error percentage is based on the retrospective 
calculation of  the contribution of  the inaccessible areas in the data for 2008. 
2.      Selection of sampling points and replacement of sampling points
The interviews were completed using multi-stage random sampling. Due to local 
cultural traditions, the sample was first divided into male and female sub-samples. Each 
region, province and further strata was allocated an equal number of  male and female 
respondents per sampling points. Field researchers of  the appropriate gender were 
allocated to conduct the interviews for each sub-sample. However, in 2009, in three 
southern provinces; Paktika, Uruzghan and Zabul, the deteriorated security situation 
restricted the freedom of  movement, making it unsafe to employ female interviewers. 
This meant that no women were included in the sample in these provinces. 
Afghanistan in 2009152
Moreover, in 2009, there were greater restrictions on the movement of  survey 
researchers than in previous years. A number of  districts in the country could not 
be surveyed because of  inaccessibility due to logistical problems, natural disasters 
and security. Overall 208 of  the 882 sampling points had to be replaced. The 
replacements were made by selecting other sampling points in the same region. The 
instability and frequent fighting in some provinces caused 102 of  the sampling points 
across the country (12%) to be adjusted or replaced to keep interviewers out of  areas 
affected by active violence. This was a significant change from 2008 when only 17 
sampling points (3%) had to be replaced for security reasons. The regions most 
severely affected by these restrictions are the South East (18 replacements), South 
West (17 replacements) and West (15 replacements). There were 13 replacements 
each made in the East, Central/ Kabul, and North East regions. In other regions 
significant numbers of  sampling points had to be changed for security reasons 
in individual provinces including Faryab (10 replacements) in the North West, 
Kunduz (8 replacements) in the North East, Logar (5 replacements) and Kabul (4 
replacements) in the Central/Kabul region. Helmand was the only province were 
sampling point replacements did not have to be made. 
Replacement of the sampling points and the reason for replacement is described

3.      Selection of starting points within each sampling point
The settlements within districts were selected at random by the field director. Each 
sampling point was assigned a starting point and given direction. The starting points 
were recognizable locations like mosques, schools, bazaars etc within each of  the 
selected settlements for the survey.
4.  Household Selection
In urban areas, from the given starting point the interviewer headed in the assigned 
direction and stopped at the 1st street/lane on the right hand side of  his/her route. 
From there on, the 2nd contacted household was the fourth house on the right from 
the beginning of  the street. Further on, the selected household was each 3rd inhabit-
able house on the right side of  the interviewer’s route. In apartment buildings the 
selection method was each 5th apartment.
In rural areas, the interviewer started from the center of  the village or the ba-
zaar, mosque, etc. and went to the right selecting each third inhabitable house 
on his/her route. Compounds containing two or more houses behind a com-
mon wall were treated as detached houses, counting them counter-clock-wise 
from the gate to the compound.
 Appendix 2: Methodology 163
5. Respondent Selection
After selecting a household, interviewers used a Kish grid for randomizing the target 
respondent within the household.  Members of  the household were listed with their 
names and ages in descending order.
6. Respondent Substitution
Using the Kish Grid, under no circumstances were interviewers allowed to substitute 
an alternate member of  a household for the selected respondent.  If  the respondent 
refused to participate or was not available after callbacks, the interviewer moved on 
to the next household according to the random walk. 
7. Call-backs (rate, method, and results)
Typically interviewers were required to make two call-backs before replacing the 
designated respondent. Due to security-related fears in previous deployments field 
researchers had difficulty meeting the requirement of  two call-backs prior to substi-
tution.  In this survey, while field researchers were able to complete some call-backs, 
the majority of  the interviews were completed on the first attempt (979%), 19% of  
the interviews were completed on the second attempt, and 2% of  interviews were 
completed on the third attempt. Due to the high rate of  unemployment, and choos-
ing the appropriate time of  day for interviewing, completion on the first attempt is 
the norm in Afghanistan.
8. Training of Interviewers
ACSOR first held extended training sessions with supervisors on the Interviewers’ Man-
ual which covers all the main aspects of  the field researchers’ work. This was followed 
by a briefing for interviewers on the survey questionnaire. At the end of  the detailed 
review of  the questionnaire each supervisor conducted a monitored mock interview in 
the office, and was further assigned to conduct a pilot interview in the field.
On the next day, the completed pilot interviews were reviewed for proper adminis-
tration. A briefing session was held to discuss any problems discovered during the 
pilot interviews. Each supervisor repeated the entire process with the interviewers in 
the respective province. The training typically lasted two to three days.
The briefings with supervisors were held in Kabul. Each supervisor then organized 
his/her own briefing sessions with the interviewers. The briefing on the main ques-
tions was conducted by the Project Managers Mr. Zemarak Mohsini and Mr. Jameel 
Afghanistan in 2009164
Rahmany. The Field Managers, Mr. Toryalai Tajmal Zai and Mr. Rahmatullah Faizi 
reviewed the sampling procedures. Mr. Matthew Warshaw provided guidance and 
monitored the sessions in Kabul and The Asia Foundation staff  and consultants 
attended briefings as well. Issues emphasized during the briefing were: a) proper 
household and respondent selection, b) review of  the questionnaire content, c) ap-
propriate interviewing techniques, and d) conducting pilot interviews to master logic 
and concept of  questions.

10.  Quality Control Methods
After the return of  the questionnaires from the field, most of  the completed ques-
tionnaires were subject to logical control for proper administration.
Actual interviewing was monitored directly by a supervisor for 7.1% of  the sam-
ple. Another 19% of  the completed interviews were back-checked by a supervisor 
in person. 3.8 % of  the completed interviews were back-checked from ACSOR’s 
central office. The Asia Foundation also contributed to the quality control by back 
checking 188 (2.9%) of  the interviews across 10 provinces. The issues verified dur-
ing in person back-checks included proper household and respondent selection and 
correct recording of  answers to five randomly selected questions from the main 
body of  the questionnaire.
In total, 212 interviews were rejected due to the low quality of  interviewers’ work. 
These interviews were not kept in the final data set. Three interviewers were dis-
missed due to poor performance.
Appendix 2: Methodology 165
11. Weighting
The data set includes a weight to adjust for over-sampling and under-sampling at the 
provincial level. The data was weighted to be representative of  national population distri-
bution according to the population statistics available from the Afghan Central Statistics 
Office. Below is the entire list of  weights assigned to rural and urban areas by province.

Q-75. When people talk about elections, they often describe them as free and fair. By 
“free,” they generally mean that all people had the chance to vote as they wished, 
and that they were not forced to vote for a particular party or candidate. By 
“fair”, on the other hand, people generally mean that all candidates/parties were 
given equal access to public channels of  communications, that they were not 
prevented from getting their message across to voters, and that the cast votes 
were counted correctly and not manipulated. Thinking about what is meant by 
“free” and “fair”:
