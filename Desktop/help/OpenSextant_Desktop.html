        <h1>Desktop Geocoding<br>
        </h1>

        <div><p>
          OpenSextant Desktop is is Java Swing based desktop application that allows users to run the OpenSextant software to geocode documents.  This software can handle a variety of formats and will extract geocoded information from these documents and output that data to CSV, Shapefile, KML, JSON, or WKT.
          <br/><br/>
          To open the OpenSextant desktop application, double click on the OpenSextantDesktop-vx.x.jar file under the desktop/ directory in an OpenSextant release.
          <br/><br/>
          In order to run, you will need the Gazetteer Solr data.  This should be available with an OpenSextant release.
          <br/><br/>
          When the application opens, you should see the main OpenSextant Desktop window.
          <br/>
        </p></div>

        <div><p>
          At the top of the main window you will find a File menu and a Help menu.  The file menu allows you to:
          <ul>
            <li>Add File(s) - Opens a file selection dialog to add files or directories for processing.</li>
            <li>Text Entry - Allows pasting text directly into an input field for processing.</li>
            <li>Configuration - Opens a configuration dialog to configure OpenSextant Desktop options.</li>
            <li>Exit - Closes OpenSextant Desktop.</li>
          </ul>
        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/file_menu.png" width="200px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          The help menu allows you to:
          <ul>
            <li>Help - Opens a help page.</li>
            <li>About - Provides information about OpenSextant Desktop.</li>
          </ul>
        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/help_menu.png" width="200px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          Selecting File > Text Entry opens the following dialog.  You can paste text into the input dialog and click the Add button to process the pasted text using OpenSextant Desktop.
        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/text_entry.png" width="400px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          Selecting File > Configuration opens the following dialog.  This dialog provides the following configuration options:
          <ul>
            <li>Path - Defines the location that output files generated by OpenSextant Desktop will be stored.</li>
            <li>Format - The output format that the output files will be generated in.</li>
            <li>Threads - The number of threads that will be used to conduct processing.  The number of threads should not be set higher than the number of available processor cores on the machine.  Also, each thread requires about 1Gb of memory, so the number of threads should not exceed the RAM of the machine in Gb.</li>
          </ul>        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/config.png" width="400px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          In addition to adding files or directories using the File > Add File(s) option, you can also drag files from the file system onto the Main OpenSextant window.  This will add those files for processing.
        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/drag.png" width="680px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          Once files or directories have been added, they will begin processing.  There is an initialization phase that may delay the start of processing by up to a minute.  Once the initialization  has completed, processing should start automatically.  As more files are added, they will be queued behind files that are already processing and will start once resources are available.  Each job in the OpenSextant window represents one unit of processing.  A job can either be a single file or a directory.  One thread will process each job (either a single file or a directory), and each job will produce a single output file with all of the extracted geocode data.  If a directory is added to OpenSextant for processing, all the files underneath that directory (recursing multiple levels of directory hierarchy) will be processed.
        </p></div>

        <div><p>
          Under the actions column there are various buttons for actions that can be performed on the job.  While the jbo is processing the actions are (from left to right) cancel execution, re-run, and view results.  While the job is processing the re-run and view results buttons are disabled.  They become enabled once the job completes.  When the job completes, the cancel execution button gets replaced with the delete job button.  The following actions can be conducted on each job.
          <ul>
            <li>Cancel Execution - Cancels a currently running job.</li>
            <li>Delete Job - Removes a job and it's output data.</li>
            <li>Re-Run - Executes a previously executed job again.</li>
            <li>View Results - Opens the results of the execution.</li>
          </ul>

        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/processing_buttons.png" width="100px"/><br/>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/complete_buttons.png" width="100px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          In addition to using the action buttons individual or multiple jobs can be selected by left clicking on them.  Holding shift and clicking select will select a block of rows, and holding control and clicking will select multiple non-consecutive rows.  Also, pressing Control+a will select all the rows.  Once rows are selected, right clicking on selected rows will open a context menu.  The context menu allows you to delete/cancel jobs, re-run jobs, and view the results of jobs.
        </p></div>
        <img src="./resources/osd_images/right_click.png" width="680px"/><br/>
        <div><p>
          The job is complete once the progres of the job reaches 100%.  Once the job completes you can view the results of the execution.
