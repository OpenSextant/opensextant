# tokenization rules in GATE require just about everything is a token
# so text like 
# 
#    we're heading to the park ...    => [ we, re, heading, to, the, park ]
#    Mexico's valient effort to...    => [ mexico, s, valient, effort, to ]
# etc.  
#
# Converting that very pervasive apostrophe to a space yields two tokens from one.
# Regardless if the context of the apostrophe is inside a proper name, a contraction, or a possessive
# the tokenization principle must be the same.

"'" => " "
